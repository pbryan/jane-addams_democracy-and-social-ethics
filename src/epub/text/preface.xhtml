			<p>The following pages present the substance of a course of twelve lectures on "Democracy and Social Ethics" which have been delivered at various colleges and university extension centres.</p>
			<p>In putting them into the form of a book, no attempt has been made to change the somewhat informal style used in speaking. The "we" and "us" which originally referred to the speaker and her audience are merely extended to possible readers.</p>
			<p>Acknowledgment for permission to reprint is extended to <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>The International Journal of Ethics</i>, <i>The American Journal of Sociology</i>, and to <i>The Commons</i>.</p>
