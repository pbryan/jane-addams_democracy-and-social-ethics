<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p>The following pages present the substance of a course of twelve lectures
on "Democracy and Social Ethics" which have been delivered at various
colleges and university extension centres.</p>

<p>In putting them into the form of a book, no attempt has been made to
change the somewhat informal style used in speaking. The "we" and "us"
which originally referred to the speaker and her audience are merely
extended to possible readers.</p>

Monthly</i>, <i>The International Journal of Ethics</i>, <i>The American Journal
of Sociology</i>, and to <i>The Commons</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>It is well to remind ourselves, from time to time, that "Ethics" is but
another word for "righteousness," that for which many men and women of
every generation have hungered and thirsted, and without which life
becomes meaningless.</p>

<p>Certain forms of personal righteousness have become to a majority of the
community almost automatic. It is as easy for most of us to keep from
stealing our dinners as it is to digest them, and there is quite as much
voluntary morality involved in one process as in the other. To steal
would be for us to fall sadly below the standard of habit and
expectation which makes virtue easy. In the same way we have been
carefully reared to a sense of family
obligation, to be kindly and considerate to the members of our own
households, and to feel responsible for their well-being. As the rules
of conduct have become established in regard to our self-development and
our families, so they have been in regard to limited circles of friends.
If the fulfilment of these claims were all that a righteous life
required, the hunger and thirst would be stilled for many good men and
women, and the clew of right living would lie easily in their hands.</p>

<p>But we all know that each generation has its own test, the
contemporaneous and current standard by which alone it can adequately
judge of its own moral achievements, and that it may not legitimately
use a previous and less vigorous test. The advanced test must indeed
include that which has already been attained; but if it includes no
more, we shall fail to go forward, thinking complacently that we have
"arrived" when in reality we have not yet started.</p>

<p>To attain individual morality in an age
demanding social morality, to pride one's self on the results of
personal effort when the time demands social adjustment, is utterly to
fail to apprehend the situation.</p>

<p>It is perhaps significant that a German critic has of late reminded us
that the one test which the most authoritative and dramatic portrayal of
the Day of Judgment offers, is the social test. The stern questions are
not in regard to personal and family relations, but did ye visit the
poor, the criminal, the sick, and did ye feed the hungry?</p>

<p>All about us are men and women who have become unhappy in regard to
their attitude toward the social order itself; toward the dreary round
of uninteresting work, the pleasures narrowed down to those of appetite,
the declining consciousness of brain power, and the lack of mental food
which characterizes the lot of the large proportion of their
fellow-citizens. These men and women have caught a moral challenge
raised by the exigencies of contemporaneous life; some are bewildered,
others who are denied the relief which sturdy
action brings are even seeking an escape, but all are increasingly
anxious concerning their actual relations to the basic organization of
society.</p>

<p>The test which they would apply to their conduct is a social test. They
fail to be content with the fulfilment of their family and personal
obligations, and find themselves striving to respond to a new demand
involving a social obligation; they have become conscious of another
requirement, and the contribution they would make is toward a code of
social ethics. The conception of life which they hold has not yet
expressed itself in social changes or legal enactment, but rather in a
mental attitude of maladjustment, and in a sense of divergence between
their consciences and their conduct. They desire both a clearer
definition of the code of morality adapted to present day demands and a
part in its fulfilment, both a creed and a practice of social morality.
In the perplexity of this intricate situation at least one thing is
becoming clear: if the latter day moral ideal
is in reality that of a social morality, it is inevitable that those who
desire it must be brought in contact with the moral experiences of the
many in order to procure an adequate social motive.</p>

<p>These men and women have realized this and have disclosed the fact in
their eagerness for a wider acquaintance with and participation in the
life about them. They believe that experience gives the easy and
trustworthy impulse toward right action in the broad as well as in the
narrow relations. We may indeed imagine many of them saying: "Cast our
experiences in a larger mould if our lives are to be animated by the
larger social aims. We have met the obligations of our family life, not
because we had made resolutions to that end, but spontaneously, because
of a common fund of memories and affections, from which the obligation
naturally develops, and we see no other way in which to prepare
ourselves for the larger social duties." Such a demand is reasonable,
for by our daily experience we have discovered
that we cannot mechanically hold up a moral standard, then jump at it in
rare moments of exhilaration when we have the strength for it, but that
even as the ideal itself must be a rational development of life, so the
strength to attain it must be secured from interest in life itself. We
slowly learn that life consists of processes as well as results, and
that failure may come quite as easily from ignoring the adequacy of
one's method as from selfish or ignoble aims. We are thus brought to a
conception of Democracy not merely as a sentiment which desires the
well-being of all men, nor yet as a creed which believes in the
essential dignity and equality of all men, but as that which affords a
rule of living as well as a test of faith.</p>

<p>We are learning that a standard of social ethics is not attained by
travelling a sequestered byway, but by mixing on the thronged and common
road where all must turn out for one another, and at least see the size
of one another's burdens. To follow the path of
social morality results perforce in the temper if not the practice of
the democratic spirit, for it implies that diversified human experience
and resultant sympathy which are the foundation and guarantee of
Democracy.</p>

<p>There are many indications that this conception of Democracy is growing
among us. We have come to have an enormous interest in human life as
such, accompanied by confidence in its essential soundness. We do not
believe that genuine experience can lead us astray any more than
scientific data can.</p>

<p>We realize, too, that social perspective and sanity of judgment come
only from contact with social experience; that such contact is the
surest corrective of opinions concerning the social order, and
concerning efforts, however humble, for its improvement. Indeed, it is a
consciousness of the illuminating and dynamic value of this wider and
more thorough human experience which explains in no small degree that
new curiosity regarding human life which has
more of a moral basis than an intellectual one.</p>

<p>The newspapers, in a frank reflection of popular demand, exhibit an
omniverous curiosity equally insistent upon the trivial and the
important. They are perhaps the most obvious manifestations of that
desire to know, that "What is this?" and "Why do you do that?" of the
child. The first dawn of the social consciousness takes this form, as
the dawning intelligence of the child takes the form of constant
question and insatiate curiosity.</p>

<p>Literature, too, portrays an equally absorbing though better adjusted
desire to know all kinds of life. The popular books are the novels,
dealing with life under all possible conditions, and they are widely
read not only because they are entertaining, but also because they in a
measure satisfy an unformulated belief that to see farther, to know all
sorts of men, in an indefinite way, is a preparation for better social
adjustment—for the remedying of social ills.</p>

<p>Doubtless one under the conviction of sin in
regard to social ills finds a vague consolation in reading about the
lives of the poor, and derives a sense of complicity in doing good. He
likes to feel that he knows about social wrongs even if he does not
remedy them, and in a very genuine sense there is a foundation for this
belief.</p>

<p>Partly through this wide reading of human life, we find in ourselves a
new affinity for all men, which probably never existed in the world
before. Evil itself does not shock us as it once did, and we count only
that man merciful in whom we recognize an understanding of the criminal.
We have learned as common knowledge that much of the insensibility and
hardness of the world is due to the lack of imagination which prevents a
realization of the experiences of other people. Already there is a
conviction that we are under a moral obligation in choosing our
experiences, since the result of those experiences must ultimately determine our understanding of life. We know
instinctively that if we grow contemptuous of our fellows, and
consciously limit our intercourse to certain kinds of people whom we
have previously decided to respect, we not only tremendously
circumscribe our range of life, but limit the scope of our ethics.</p>

<p>We can recall among the selfish people of our acquaintance at least one
common characteristic,—the conviction that they are different from
other men and women, that they need peculiar consideration because they
are more sensitive or more refined. Such people "refuse to be bound by
any relation save the personally luxurious ones of love and admiration,
or the identity of political opinion, or religious creed." We have
learned to recognize them as selfish, although we blame them not for the
will which chooses to be selfish, but for a narrowness of interest which
deliberately selects its experience within a limited sphere, and we say
that they illustrate the danger of
concentrating the mind on narrow and unprogressive issues.</p>

<p>We know, at last, that we can only discover truth by a rational and
democratic interest in life, and to give truth complete social
expression is the endeavor upon which we are entering. Thus the
identification with the common lot which is the essential idea of
Democracy becomes the source and expression of social ethics. It is as
though we thirsted to drink at the great wells of human experience,
because we knew that a daintier or less potent draught would not carry
us to the end of the journey, going forward as we must in the heat and
jostle of the crowd.</p>

<p>The six following chapters are studies of various types and groups who
are being impelled by the newer conception of Democracy to an acceptance
of social obligations involving in each instance a new line of conduct.
No attempt is made to reach a conclusion, nor to offer advice beyond the
assumption that the cure for the ills of
Democracy is more Democracy, but the quite unlooked-for result of the
studies would seem to indicate that while the strain and perplexity of
the situation is felt most keenly by the educated and self-conscious
members of the community, the tentative and actual attempts at
adjustment are largely coming through those who are simpler and less
analytical.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h4>CHARITABLE EFFORT</h4>

<p>All those hints and glimpses of a larger and more satisfying democracy,
which literature and our own hopes supply, have a tendency to slip away
from us and to leave us sadly unguided and perplexed when we attempt to
act upon them.</p>

<p>Our conceptions of morality, as all our other ideas, pass through a
course of development; the difficulty comes in adjusting our conduct,
which has become hardened into customs and habits, to these changing
moral conceptions. When this adjustment is not made, we suffer from the
strain and indecision of believing one hypothesis and acting upon
another.</p>

<p>Probably there is no relation in life which our democracy is changing
more rapidly than the charitable relation—that
relation which obtains between benefactor and beneficiary; at the same
time there is no point of contact in our modern experience which reveals
so clearly the lack of that equality which democracy implies. We have
reached the moment when democracy has made such inroads upon this
relationship, that the complacency of the old-fashioned charitable man
is gone forever; while, at the same time, the very need and existence of
charity, denies us the consolation and freedom which democracy will at
last give.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that the ethics of none of us are clearly defined,
and we are continually obliged to act in circles of habit, based upon
convictions which we no longer hold. Thus our estimate of the effect of
environment and social conditions has doubtless shifted faster than our
methods of administrating charity have changed. Formerly when it was
believed that poverty was synonymous with vice and laziness, and that the prosperous man was the righteous man, charity
was administered harshly with a good conscience; for the charitable
agent really blamed the individual for his poverty, and the very fact of
his own superior prosperity gave him a certain consciousness of superior
morality. We have learned since that time to measure by other standards,
and have ceased to accord to the money-earning capacity exclusive
respect; while it is still rewarded out of all proportion to any other,
its possession is by no means assumed to imply the possession of the
highest moral qualities. We have learned to judge men by their social
virtues as well as by their business capacity, by their devotion to
intellectual and disinterested aims, and by their public spirit, and we
naturally resent being obliged to judge poor people so solely upon the
industrial side. Our democratic instinct instantly takes alarm. It is
largely in this modern tendency to judge all men by one democratic
standard, while the old charitable attitude
commonly allowed the use of two standards, that much of the difficulty
adheres. We know that unceasing bodily toil becomes wearing and
brutalizing, and our position is totally untenable if we judge large
numbers of our fellows solely upon their success in maintaining it.</p>

<p>The daintily clad charitable visitor who steps into the little house
made untidy by the vigorous efforts of her hostess, the washerwoman, is
no longer sure of her superiority to the latter; she recognizes that her
hostess after all represents social value and industrial use, as over
against her own parasitic cleanliness and a social standing attained
only through status.</p>

<p>The only families who apply for aid to the charitable agencies are those
who have come to grief on the industrial side; it may be through
sickness, through loss of work, or for other guiltless and inevitable
reasons; but the fact remains that they are industrially ailing, and
must be bolstered and helped into industrial health. The charity
visitor, let us assume, is a young college
woman, well-bred and open-minded; when she visits the family assigned to
her, she is often embarrassed to find herself obliged to lay all the
stress of her teaching and advice upon the industrial virtues, and to
treat the members of the family almost exclusively as factors in the
industrial system. She insists that they must work and be
self-supporting, that the most dangerous of all situations is idleness,
that seeking one's own pleasure, while ignoring claims and
responsibilities, is the most ignoble of actions. The members of her
assigned family may have other charms and virtues—they may possibly be
kind and considerate of each other, generous to their friends, but it is
her business to stick to the industrial side. As she daily holds up
these standards, it often occurs to the mind of the sensitive visitor,
whose conscience has been made tender by much talk of brotherhood and
equality, that she has no right to say these things; that her untrained
hands are no more fitted to cope with actual
conditions than those of her broken-down family.</p>

<p>The grandmother of the charity visitor could have done the industrial
preaching very well, because she did have the industrial virtues and
housewifely training. In a generation our experiences have changed, and
our views with them; but we still keep on in the old methods, which
could be applied when our consciences were in line with them, but which
are daily becoming more difficult as we divide up into people who work
with their hands and those who do not. The charity visitor belonging to
the latter class is perplexed by recognitions and suggestions which the
situation forces upon her. Our democracy has taught us to apply our
moral teaching all around, and the moralist is rapidly becoming so
sensitive that when his life does not exemplify his ethical convictions,
he finds it difficult to preach.</p>

<p>Added to this is a consciousness, in the mind
of the visitor, of a genuine misunderstanding of her motives by the
recipients of her charity, and by their neighbors. Let us take a
neighborhood of poor people, and test their ethical standards by those
of the charity visitor, who comes with the best desire in the world to
help them out of their distress. A most striking incongruity, at once
apparent, is the difference between the emotional kindness with which
relief is given by one poor neighbor to another poor neighbor, and the
guarded care with which relief is given by a charity visitor to a
charity recipient. The neighborhood mind is at once confronted not only
by the difference of method, but by an absolute clashing of two ethical
standards.</p>

<p>A very little familiarity with the poor districts of any city is
sufficient to show how primitive and genuine are the neighborly
relations. There is the greatest willingness to lend or borrow anything,
and all the residents of the given tenement know the most intimate
family affairs of all the others. The fact that
the economic condition of all alike is on a most precarious level makes
the ready outflow of sympathy and material assistance the most natural
thing in the world. There are numberless instances of self-sacrifice
quite unknown in the circles where greater economic advantages make that
kind of intimate knowledge of one's neighbors impossible. An Irish
family in which the man has lost his place, and the woman is struggling
to eke out the scanty savings by day's work, will take in the widow and
her five children who have been turned into the street, without a
moment's reflection upon the physical discomforts involved. The most
maligned landlady who lives in the house with her tenants is usually
ready to lend a scuttle full of coal to one of them who may be out of
work, or to share her supper. A woman for whom the writer had long tried
in vain to find work failed to appear at the appointed time when
employment was secured at last. Upon investigation it transpired that a
neighbor further down the street was taken ill,
that the children ran for the family friend, who went of course, saying
simply when reasons for her non-appearance were demanded, "It broke me
heart to leave the place, but what could I do?" A woman whose husband
was sent up to the city prison for the maximum term, just three months,
before the birth of her child found herself penniless at the end of that
time, having gradually sold her supply of household furniture. She took
refuge with a friend whom she supposed to be living in three rooms in
another part of town. When she arrived, however, she discovered that her
friend's husband had been out of work so long that they had been reduced
to living in one room. The friend, however, took her in, and the
friend's husband was obliged to sleep upon a bench in the park every
night for a week, which he did uncomplainingly if not cheerfully.
Fortunately it was summer, "and it only rained one night." The writer
could not discover from the young mother that she had any special claim upon the "friend" beyond the
fact that they had formerly worked together in the same factory. The
husband she had never seen until the night of her arrival, when he at
once went forth in search of a midwife who would consent to come upon
his promise of future payment.</p>

<p>The evolutionists tell us that the instinct to pity, the impulse to aid
his fellows, served man at a very early period, as a rude rule of right
and wrong. There is no doubt that this rude rule still holds among many
people with whom charitable agencies are brought into contact, and that
their ideas of right and wrong are quite honestly outraged by the
methods of these agencies. When they see the delay and caution with
which relief is given, it does not appear to them a conscientious
scruple, but as the cold and calculating action of a selfish man. It is
not the aid that they are accustomed to receive from their neighbors,
and they do not understand why the impulse which drives people to "be
good to the poor" should be so severely
supervised. They feel, remotely, that the charity visitor is moved by
motives that are alien and unreal. They may be superior motives, but
they are different, and they are "agin nature." They cannot comprehend
why a person whose intellectual perceptions are stronger than his
natural impulses, should go into charity work at all. The only man they
are accustomed to see whose intellectual perceptions are stronger than
his tenderness of heart, is the selfish and avaricious man who is
frankly "on the make." If the charity visitor is such a person, why does
she pretend to like the poor? Why does she not go into business at once?</p>

<p>We may say, of course, that it is a primitive view of life, which thus
confuses intellectuality and business ability; but it is a view quite
honestly held by many poor people who are obliged to receive charity
from time to time. In moments of indignation the poor have been known to
say: "What do you want, anyway? If you have nothing to give us, why not let us alone and stop your
questionings and investigations?" "They investigated me for three weeks,
and in the end gave me nothing but a black character," a little woman
has been heard to assert. This indignation, which is for the most part
taciturn, and a certain kindly contempt for her abilities, often puzzles
the charity visitor. The latter may be explained by the standard of
worldly success which the visited families hold. Success does not
ordinarily go, in the minds of the poor, with charity and
kind-heartedness, but rather with the opposite qualities. The rich
landlord is he who collects with sternness, who accepts no excuse, and
will have his own. There are moments of irritation and of real
bitterness against him, but there is still admiration, because he is
rich and successful. The good-natured landlord, he who pities and spares
his poverty-pressed tenants, is seldom rich. He often lives in the back
of his house, which he has owned for a long time, perhaps has inherited;
but he has been able to accumulate little. He
commands the genuine love and devotion of many a poor soul, but he is
treated with a certain lack of respect. In one sense he is a failure.
The charity visitor, just because she is a person who concerns herself
with the poor, receives a certain amount of this good-natured and kindly
contempt, sometimes real affection, but little genuine respect. The poor
are accustomed to help each other and to respond according to their
kindliness; but when it comes to worldly judgment, they use industrial
success as the sole standard. In the case of the charity visitor who has
neither natural kindness nor dazzling riches, they are deprived of both
standards, and they find it of course utterly impossible to judge of the
motive of organized charity.</p>

<p>Even those of us who feel most sorely the need of more order in
altruistic effort and see the end to be desired, find something
distasteful in the juxtaposition of the words "organized" and "charity."
We say in defence that we are striving to turn this emotion into a motive, that pity is capricious,
and not to be depended on; that we mean to give it the dignity of
conscious duty. But at bottom we distrust a little a scheme which
substitutes a theory of social conduct for the natural promptings of the
heart, even although we appreciate the complexity of the situation. The
poor man who has fallen into distress, when he first asks aid,
instinctively expects tenderness, consideration, and forgiveness. If it
is the first time, it has taken him long to make up his mind to take the
step. He comes somewhat bruised and battered, and instead of being met
with warmth of heart and sympathy, he is at once chilled by an
investigation and an intimation that he ought to work. He does not
recognize the disciplinary aspect of the situation.</p>

<p>The only really popular charity is that of the visiting nurses, who by
virtue of their professional training render services which may easily
be interpreted into sympathy and kindness, ministering as they do to
obvious needs which do not require investigation.</p>

<p>The state of mind which an investigation arouses
on both sides is most unfortunate; but the perplexity and clashing of
different standards, with the consequent misunderstandings, are not so
bad as the moral deterioration which is almost sure to follow.</p>

<p>When the agent or visitor appears among the poor, and they discover that
under certain conditions food and rent and medical aid are dispensed
from some unknown source, every man, woman, and child is quick to learn
what the conditions may be, and to follow them. Though in their eyes a
glass of beer is quite right and proper when taken as any
self-respecting man should take it; though they know that cleanliness is
an expensive virtue which can be required of few; though they realize
that saving is well-nigh impossible when but a few cents can be laid by
at a time; though their feeling for the church may be something quite
elusive of definition and quite apart from daily living: to the visitor
they gravely laud temperance and cleanliness and thrift and religious observance. The deception in the
first instances arises from a wondering inability to understand the
ethical ideals which can require such impossible virtues, and from an
innocent desire to please. It is easy to trace the development of the
mental suggestions thus received. When A discovers that B, who is very
little worse off than he, receives good things from an inexhaustible
supply intended for the poor at large, he feels that he too has a claim
for his share, and step by step there is developed the competitive
spirit which so horrifies charity visitors when it shows itself in a
tendency to "work" the relief-giving agencies.</p>

<p>The most serious effect upon the poor comes when dependence upon the
charitable society is substituted for the natural outgoing of human love
and sympathy, which, happily, we all possess in some degree. The
spontaneous impulse to sit up all night with the neighbor's sick child
is turned into righteous indignation against
the district nurse, because she goes home at six o'clock, and doesn't do
it herself. Or the kindness which would have prompted the quick purchase
of much needed medicine is transformed into a voluble scoring of the
dispensary, because it gives prescriptions and not drugs; and "who can
get well on a piece of paper?"</p>

<p>If a poor woman knows that her neighbor next door has no shoes, she is
quite willing to lend her own, that her neighbor may go decently to
mass, or to work; for she knows the smallest item about the scanty
wardrobe, and cheerfully helps out. When the charity visitor comes in,
all the neighbors are baffled as to what her circumstances may be. They
know she does not need a new pair of shoes, and rather suspect that she
has a dozen pairs at home; which, indeed, she sometimes has. They
imagine untold stores which they may call upon, and her most generous
gift is considered niggardly, compared with what she might do. She ought
to get new shoes for the family all round, "she
sees well enough that they need them." It is no more than the neighbor
herself would do, has practically done, when she lent her own shoes. The
charity visitor has broken through the natural rule of giving, which, in
a primitive society, is bounded only by the need of the recipient and
the resources of the giver; and she gets herself into untold trouble
when she is judged by the ethics of that primitive society.</p>

<p>The neighborhood understands the selfish rich people who stay in their
own part of town, where all their associates have shoes and other
things. Such people don't bother themselves about the poor; they are
like the rich landlords of the neighborhood experience. But this lady
visitor, who pretends to be good to the poor, and certainly does talk as
though she were kind-hearted, what does she come for, if she does not
intend to give them things which are so plainly needed?</p>

<p>The visitor says, sometimes, that in holding
her poor family so hard to a standard of thrift she is really breaking
down a rule of higher living which they formerly possessed; that saving,
which seems quite commendable in a comfortable part of town, appears
almost criminal in a poorer quarter where the next-door neighbor needs
food, even if the children of the family do not.</p>

<p>She feels the sordidness of constantly being obliged to urge the
industrial view of life. The benevolent individual of fifty years ago
honestly believed that industry and self-denial in youth would result in
comfortable possessions for old age. It was, indeed, the method he had
practised in his own youth, and by which he had probably obtained
whatever fortune he possessed. He therefore reproved the poor family for
indulging their children, urged them to work long hours, and was utterly
untouched by many scruples which afflict the contemporary charity
visitor. She says sometimes, "Why must I talk always of getting work and
saving money, the things I know nothing about?
If it were anything else I had to urge, I could do it; anything like
Latin prose, which I had worried through myself, it would not be so
hard." But she finds it difficult to connect the experiences of her
youth with the experiences of the visited family.</p>

<p>Because of this diversity in experience, the visitor is continually
surprised to find that the safest platitude may be challenged. She
refers quite naturally to the "horrors of the saloon," and discovers
that the head of her visited family does not connect them with "horrors"
at all. He remembers all the kindnesses he has received there, the free
lunch and treating which goes on, even when a man is out of work and not
able to pay up; the loan of five dollars he got there when the charity
visitor was miles away and he was threatened with eviction. He may
listen politely to her reference to "horrors," but considers it only
"temperance talk."</p>

<p>The charity visitor may blame the women for
lack of gentleness toward their children, for being hasty and rude to
them, until she learns that the standard of breeding is not that of
gentleness toward the children so much as the observance of certain
conventions, such as the punctilious wearing of mourning garments after
the death of a child. The standard of gentleness each mother has to work
out largely by herself, assisted only by the occasional shame-faced
remark of a neighbor, "That they do better when you are not too hard on
them"; but the wearing of mourning garments is sustained by the
definitely expressed sentiment of every woman in the street. The mother
would have to bear social blame, a certain social ostracism, if she
failed to comply with that requirement. It is not comfortable to outrage
the conventions of those among whom we live, and, if our social life be
a narrow one, it is still more difficult. The visitor may choke a little
when she sees the lessened supply of food and the scanty clothing
provided for the remaining children in order that one may be conventionally mourned, but she doesn't
talk so strongly against it as she would have done during her first
month of experience with the family since bereaved.</p>

<p>The subject of clothes indeed perplexes the visitor constantly, and the
result of her reflections may be summed up somewhat in this wise: The
girl who has a definite social standing, who has been to a fashionable
school or to a college, whose family live in a house seen and known by
all her friends and associates, may afford to be very simple, or even
shabby as to her clothes, if she likes. But the working girl, whose
family lives in a tenement, or moves from one small apartment to
another, who has little social standing and has to make her own place,
knows full well how much habit and style of dress has to do with her
position. Her income goes into her clothing, out of all proportion to
the amount which she spends upon other things. But, if social
advancement is her aim, it is the most sensible thing she can do. She is
judged largely by her clothes. Her house
furnishing, with its pitiful little decorations, her scanty supply of
books, are never seen by the people whose social opinions she most
values. Her clothes are her background, and from them she is largely
judged. It is due to this fact that girls' clubs succeed best in the
business part of town, where "working girls" and "young ladies" meet
upon an equal footing, and where the clothes superficially look very
much alike. Bright and ambitious girls will come to these down-town
clubs to eat lunch and rest at noon, to study all sorts of subjects and
listen to lectures, when they might hesitate a long time before joining
a club identified with their own neighborhood, where they would be
judged not solely on their own merits and the unconscious social
standing afforded by good clothes, but by other surroundings which are
not nearly up to these. For the same reason, girls' clubs are infinitely
more difficult to organize in little towns and villages, where every one knows every one else, just how the front
parlor is furnished, and the amount of mortgage there is upon the house.
These facts get in the way of a clear and unbiassed judgment; they
impede the democratic relationship and add to the self-consciousness of
all concerned. Every one who has had to do with down-town girls' clubs
has had the experience of going into the home of some bright,
well-dressed girl, to discover it uncomfortable and perhaps wretched,
and to find the girl afterward carefully avoiding her, although the
working girl may not have been at home when the call was made, and the
visitor may have carried herself with the utmost courtesy throughout. In
some very successful down-town clubs the home address is not given at
all, and only the "business address" is required. Have we worked out our
democracy further in regard to clothes than anything else?</p>

<p>The charity visitor has been rightly brought up to consider it vulgar to
spend much money upon clothes, to care so much
for "appearances." She realizes dimly that the care for personal
decoration over that for one's home or habitat is in some way primitive
and undeveloped; but she is silenced by its obvious need. She also
catches a glimpse of the fact that the disproportionate expenditure of
the poor in the matter of clothes is largely due to the exclusiveness of
the rich who hide from them the interior of their houses, and their more
subtle pleasures, while of necessity exhibiting their street clothes and
their street manners. Every one who goes shopping at the same time may
see the clothes of the richest women in town, but only those invited to
her receptions see the Corot on her walls or the bindings in her
library. The poor naturally try to bridge the difference by reproducing
the street clothes which they have seen. They are striving to conform to
a common standard which their democratic training presupposes belongs to
all of us. The charity visitor may regret that
the Italian peasant woman has laid aside her picturesque kerchief and
substituted a cheap street hat. But it is easy to recognize the first
attempt toward democratic expression.</p>

<p>The charity visitor finds herself still more perplexed when she comes to
consider such problems as those of early marriage and child labor; for
she cannot deal with them according to economic theories, or according
to the conventions which have regulated her own life. She finds both of
these fairly upset by her intimate knowledge of the situation, and her
sympathy for those into whose lives she has gained a curious insight.
She discovers how incorrigibly bourgeois her standards have been, and it
takes but a little time to reach the conclusion that she cannot insist
so strenuously upon the conventions of her own class, which fail to fit
the bigger, more emotional, and freer lives of working people. The
charity visitor holds well-grounded views upon the imprudence of early
marriages, quite naturally because she comes
from a family and circle of professional and business people. A
professional man is scarcely equipped and started in his profession
before he is thirty. A business man, if he is on the road to success, is
much nearer prosperity at thirty-five than twenty-five, and it is
therefore wise for these men not to marry in the twenties; but this does
not apply to the workingman. In many trades he is laid upon the shelf at
thirty-five, and in nearly all trades he receives the largest wages in
his life between twenty and thirty. If the young workingman has all his
wages to himself, he will probably establish habits of personal comfort,
which he cannot keep up when he has to divide with a family—habits
which he can, perhaps, never overcome.</p>

<p>The sense of prudence, the necessity for saving, can never come to a
primitive, emotional man with the force of a conviction; but the
necessity of providing for his children is a powerful incentive. He
naturally regards his children as his savings-bank; he expects them to care for him when he gets old, and
in some trades old age comes very early. A Jewish tailor was quite
lately sent to the Cook County poorhouse, paralyzed beyond recovery at
the age of thirty-five. Had his little boy of nine been but a few years
older, he might have been spared this sorrow of public charity. He was,
in fact, better able to well support a family when he was twenty than
when he was thirty-five, for his wages had steadily grown less as the
years went on. Another tailor whom I know, who is also a Socialist,
always speaks of saving as a bourgeois virtue, one quite impossible to
the genuine workingman. He supports a family consisting of himself, a
wife and three children, and his two parents on eight dollars a week. He
insists it would be criminal not to expend every penny of this amount
upon food and shelter, and he expects his children later to care for
him.</p>

<p>This economic pressure also accounts for the tendency to put children to
work overyoung and thus cripple their chances
for individual development and usefulness, and with the avaricious
parent also leads to exploitation. "I have fed her for fourteen years,
now she can help me pay my mortgage" is not an unusual reply when a
hardworking father is expostulated with because he would take his bright
daughter out of school and put her into a factory.</p>

<p>It has long been a common error for the charity visitor, who is strongly
urging her "family" toward self-support, to suggest, or at least
connive, that the children be put to work early, although she has not
the excuse that the parents have. It is so easy, after one has been
taking the industrial view for a long time, to forget the larger and
more social claim; to urge that the boy go to work and support his
parents, who are receiving charitable aid. She does not realize what a
cruel advantage the person who distributes charity has, when she gives
advice.</p>

<p>The manager in a huge mercantile establishment employing many children
was able to show during a child-labor
investigation, that the only children under fourteen years of age in his
employ were protégés who had been urged upon him by philanthropic
ladies, not only acquaintances of his, but valued patrons of the
establishment. It is not that the charity visitor is less wise than
other people, but she has fixed her mind so long upon the industrial
lameness of her family that she is eager to seize any crutch, however
weak, which may enable them to get on.</p>

<p>She has failed to see that the boy who attempts to prematurely support
his widowed mother may lower wages, add an illiterate member to the
community, and arrest the development of a capable workingman. As she
has failed to see that the rules which obtain in regard to the age of
marriage in her own family may not apply to the workingman, so also she
fails to understand that the present conditions of employment
surrounding a factory child are totally unlike those which obtained
during the energetic youth of her father.</p>

<p>The child who is prematurely put to work is
constantly oppressed by this never ending question of the means of
subsistence, and even little children are sometimes almost crushed with
the cares of life through their affectionate sympathy. The writer knows
a little Italian lad of six to whom the problems of food, clothing, and
shelter have become so immediate and pressing that, although an
imaginative child, he is unable to see life from any other standpoint.
The goblin or bugaboo, feared by the more fortunate child, in his mind,
has come to be the need of coal which caused his father hysterical and
demonstrative grief when it carried off his mother's inherited linen,
the mosaic of St. Joseph, and, worst of all, his own rubber boots. He
once came to a party at Hull-House, and was interested in nothing save a
gas stove which he saw in the kitchen. He became excited over the
discovery that fire could be produced without fuel. "I will tell my
father of this stove. You buy no coal, you need only a match. Anybody
will give you a match." He was taken to visit
at a country-house and at once inquired how much rent was paid for it.
On being told carelessly by his hostess that they paid no rent for that
house, he came back quite wild with interest that the problem was
solved. "Me and my father will go to the country. You get a big house,
all warm, without rent." Nothing else in the country interested him but
the subject of rent, and he talked of that with an exclusiveness worthy
of a single taxer.</p>

<p>The struggle for existence, which is so much harsher among people near
the edge of pauperism, sometimes leaves ugly marks on character, and the
charity visitor finds these indirect results most mystifying. Parents
who work hard and anticipate an old age when they can no longer earn,
take care that their children shall expect to divide their wages with
them from the very first. Such a parent, when successful, impresses the
immature nervous system of the child thus tyrannically establishing
habits of obedience, so that the nerves and
will may not depart from this control when the child is older. The
charity visitor, whose family relation is lifted quite out of this, does
not in the least understand the industrial foundation for this family
tyranny.</p>

<p>The head of a kindergarten training-class once addressed a club of
working women, and spoke of the despotism which is often established
over little children. She said that the so-called determination to break
a child's will many times arose from a lust of dominion, and she urged
the ideal relationship founded upon love and confidence. But many of the
women were puzzled. One of them remarked to the writer as she came out
of the club room, "If you did not keep control over them from the time
they were little, you would never get their wages when they are grown
up." Another one said, "Ah, of course she (meaning the speaker) doesn't
have to depend upon her children's wages. She can afford to be lax with
them, because even if they don't give money to
her, she can get along without it."</p>

<p>There are an impressive number of children who uncomplainingly and
constantly hand over their weekly wages to their parents, sometimes
receiving back ten cents or a quarter for spending-money, but quite as
often nothing at all; and the writer knows one girl of twenty-five who
for six years has received two cents a week from the constantly falling
wages which she earns in a large factory. Is it habit or virtue which
holds her steady in this course? If love and tenderness had been
substituted for parental despotism, would the mother have had enough
affection, enough power of expression to hold her daughter's sense of
money obligation through all these years? This girl who spends her
paltry two cents on chewing-gum and goes plainly clad in clothes of her
mother's choosing, while many of her friends spend their entire wages on
those clothes which factory girls love so well, must be held by some
powerful force.</p>

<p>The charity visitor finds these subtle and
elusive problems most harrowing. The head of a family she is visiting is
a man who has become black-listed in a strike. He is not a very good
workman, and this, added to his agitator's reputation, keeps him out of
work for a long time. The fatal result of being long out of work
follows: he becomes less and less eager for it, and gets a "job" less
and less frequently. In order to keep up his self-respect, and still
more to keep his wife's respect for him, he yields to the little
self-deception that this prolonged idleness follows because he was once
blacklisted, and he gradually becomes a martyr. Deep down in his heart
perhaps—but who knows what may be deep down in his heart? Whatever may
be in his wife's, she does not show for an instant that she thinks he
has grown lazy, and accustomed to see her earn, by sewing and cleaning,
most of the scanty income for the family. The charity visitor, however,
does see this, and she also sees that the other men who were in the strike have gone back to work. She
further knows by inquiry and a little experience that the man is not
skilful. She cannot, however, call him lazy and good-for-nothing, and
denounce him as worthless as her grandmother might have done, because of
certain intellectual conceptions at which she has arrived. She sees
other workmen come to him for shrewd advice; she knows that he spends
many more hours in the public library reading good books than the
average workman has time to do. He has formed no bad habits and has
yielded only to those subtle temptations toward a life of leisure which
come to the intellectual man. He lacks the qualifications which would
induce his union to engage him as a secretary or organizer, but he is a
constant speaker at workingmen's meetings, and takes a high moral
attitude on the questions discussed there. He contributes a certain
intellectuality to his friends, and he has undoubted social value. The
neighboring women confide to the charity visitor their sympathy with his wife, because she has to work so
hard, and because her husband does not "provide." Their remarks are
sharpened by a certain resentment toward the superiority of the
husband's education and gentle manners. The charity visitor is ashamed
to take this point of view, for she knows that it is not altogether
fair. She is reminded of a college friend of hers, who told her that she
was not going to allow her literary husband to write unworthy potboilers
for the sake of earning a living. "I insist that we shall live within my
own income; that he shall not publish until he is ready, and can give
his genuine message." The charity visitor recalls what she has heard of
another acquaintance, who urged her husband to decline a lucrative
position as a railroad attorney, because she wished him to be free to
take municipal positions, and handle public questions without the
inevitable suspicion which unaccountably attaches itself in a corrupt
city to a corporation attorney. The action of these two women seemed noble to her, but in their cases they
merely lived on a lesser income. In the case of the workingman's wife,
she faced living on no income at all, or on the precarious one which she
might be able to get together.</p>

<p>She sees that this third woman has made the greatest sacrifice, and she
is utterly unwilling to condemn her while praising the friends of her
own social position. She realizes, of course, that the situation is
changed by the fact that the third family needs charity, while the other
two do not; but, after all, they have not asked for it, and their plight
was only discovered through an accident to one of the children. The
charity visitor has been taught that her mission is to preserve the
finest traits to be found in her visited family, and she shrinks from
the thought of convincing the wife that her husband is worthless and she
suspects that she might turn all this beautiful devotion into
complaining drudgery. To be sure, she could give up visiting the family altogether, but she has become much
interested in the progress of the crippled child who eagerly anticipates
her visits, and she also suspects that she will never know many finer
women than the mother. She is unwilling, therefore, to give up the
friendship, and goes on bearing her perplexities as best she may.</p>

<p>The first impulse of our charity visitor is to be somewhat severe with
her shiftless family for spending money on pleasures and indulging their
children out of all proportion to their means. The poor family which
receives beans and coal from the county, and pays for a bicycle on the
instalment plan, is not unknown to any of us. But as the growth of
juvenile crime becomes gradually understood, and as the danger of giving
no legitimate and organized pleasure to the child becomes clearer, we
remember that primitive man had games long before he cared for a house
or regular meals.</p>

<p>There are certain boys in many city neighborhoods
who form themselves into little gangs with a leader who is somewhat more
intrepid than the rest. Their favorite performance is to break into an
untenanted house, to knock off the faucets, and cut the lead pipe, which
they sell to the nearest junk dealer. With the money thus procured they
buy beer and drink it in little free-booter's groups sitting in the
alley. From beginning to end they have the excitement of knowing that
they may be seen and caught by the "coppers," and are at times quite
breathless with suspense. It is not the least unlike, in motive and
execution, the practice of country boys who go forth in squads to set
traps for rabbits or to round up a coon.</p>

<p>It is characterized by a pure spirit for adventure, and the vicious
training really begins when they are arrested, or when an older boy
undertakes to guide them into further excitements. From the very
beginning the most enticing and exciting
experiences which they have seen have been connected with crime. The
policeman embodies all the majesty of successful law and established
government in his brass buttons and dazzlingly equipped patrol wagon.</p>

<p>The boy who has been arrested comes back more or less a hero with a tale
to tell of the interior recesses of the mysterious police station. The
earliest public excitement the child remembers is divided between the
rattling fire engines, "the time there was a fire in the next block,"
and all the tense interest of the patrol wagon "the time the drunkest
lady in our street was arrested."</p>

<p>In the first year of their settlement the Hull-House residents took
fifty kindergarten children to Lincoln Park, only to be grieved by their
apathetic interest in trees and flowers. As they came back with an
omnibus full of tired and sleepy children, they were surprised to find
them galvanized into sudden life because a patrol wagon rattled by. Their eager little heads popped out of the
windows full of questioning: "Was it a man or a woman?" "How many
policemen inside?" and eager little tongues began to tell experiences of
arrests which baby eyes had witnessed.</p>

<p>The excitement of a chase, the chances of competition, and the love of a
fight are all centred in the outward display of crime. The parent who
receives charitable aid and yet provides pleasure for his child, and is
willing to indulge him in his play, is blindly doing one of the wisest
things possible; and no one is more eager for playgrounds and vacation
schools than the conscientious charity visitor.</p>

<p>This very imaginative impulse and attempt to live in a pictured world of
their own, which seems the simplest prerogative of childhood, often
leads the boys into difficulty. Three boys aged seven, nine, and ten
were once brought into a neighboring police station under the charge of
pilfering and destroying property. They had dug
a cave under a railroad viaduct in which they had spent many days and
nights of the summer vacation. They had "swiped" potatoes and other
vegetables from hucksters' carts, which they had cooked and eaten in
true brigand fashion; they had decorated the interior of the excavation
with stolen junk, representing swords and firearms, to their romantic
imaginations. The father of the ringleader was a janitor living in a
building five miles away in a prosperous portion of the city. The
landlord did not want an active boy in the building, and his mother was
dead; the janitor paid for the boy's board and lodging to a needy woman
living near the viaduct. She conscientiously gave him his breakfast and
supper, and left something in the house for his dinner every morning
when she went to work in a neighboring factory; but was too tired by
night to challenge his statement that he "would rather sleep outdoors in
the summer," or to investigate what he did during the day. In the meantime the three boys lived in a world of
their own, made up from the reading of adventurous stories and their
vivid imaginations, steadily pilfering more and more as the days went
by, and actually imperilling the safety of the traffic passing over the
street on the top of the viaduct. In spite of vigorous exertions on
their behalf, one of the boys was sent to the Reform School, comforting
himself with the conclusive remark, "Well, we had fun anyway, and maybe
they will let us dig a cave at the School; it is in the country, where
we can't hurt anything."</p>

<p>In addition to books of adventure, or even reading of any sort, the
scenes and ideals of the theatre largely form the manners and morals of
the young people. "Going to the theatre" is indeed the most common and
satisfactory form of recreation. Many boys who conscientiously give all
their wages to their mothers have returned each week ten cents to pay
for a seat in the gallery of a theatre on Sunday afternoon. It is their one satisfactory glimpse of
life—the moment when they "issue forth from themselves" and are stirred
and thoroughly interested. They quite simply adopt as their own, and
imitate as best they can, all that they see there. In moments of genuine
grief and excitement the words and the gestures they employ are those
copied from the stage, and the tawdry expression often conflicts
hideously with the fine and genuine emotion of which it is the
inadequate and vulgar vehicle.</p>

<p>As in the matter of dress, more refined and simpler manners and mode of
expressions are unseen by them, and they must perforce copy what they
know.</p>

<p>If we agree with a recent definition of Art, as that which causes the
spectator to lose his sense of isolation, there is no doubt that the
popular theatre, with all its faults, more nearly fulfils the function
of art for the multitude of working people than all the "free galleries"
and picture exhibits combined.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty is experienced when the
two standards come sharply together, and when both sides make an attempt
at understanding and explanation. The difficulty of making clear one's
own ethical standpoint is at times insurmountable. A woman who had
bought and sold school books stolen from the school fund,—books which
are all plainly marked with a red stamp,—came to Hull House one morning
in great distress because she had been arrested, and begged a resident
"to speak to the judge." She gave as a reason the fact that the House
had known her for six years, and had once been very good to her when her
little girl was buried. The resident more than suspected that her
visitor knew the school books were stolen when buying them, and any
attempt to talk upon that subject was evidently considered very rude.
The visitor wished to get out of her trial, and evidently saw no reason
why the House should not help her. The alderman was out of town, so she
could not go to him. After a long conversation
the visitor entirely failed to get another point of view and went away
grieved and disappointed at a refusal, thinking the resident simply
disobliging; wondering, no doubt, why such a mean woman had once been
good to her; leaving the resident, on the other hand, utterly baffled
and in the state of mind she would have been in, had she brutally
insisted that a little child should lift weights too heavy for its
undeveloped muscles.</p>

<p>Such a situation brings out the impossibility of substituting a higher
ethical standard for a lower one without similarity of experience, but
it is not as painful as that illustrated by the following example, in
which the highest ethical standard yet attained by the charity recipient
is broken down, and the substituted one not in the least understood:—</p>

<p>A certain charity visitor is peculiarly appealed to by the weakness and
pathos of forlorn old age. She is responsible for the well-being of perhaps a dozen old women to whom
she sustains a sincerely affectionate and almost filial relation. Some
of them learn to take her benefactions quite as if they came from their
own relatives, grumbling at all she does, and scolding her with a family
freedom. One of these poor old women was injured in a fire years ago.
She has but the fragment of a hand left, and is grievously crippled in
her feet. Through years of pain she had become addicted to opium, and
when she first came under the visitor's care, was only held from the
poorhouse by the awful thought that she would there perish without her
drug. Five years of tender care have done wonders for her. She lives in
two neat little rooms, where with her thumb and two fingers she makes
innumerable quilts, which she sells and gives away with the greatest
delight. Her opium is regulated to a set amount taken each day, and she
has been drawn away from much drinking. She is a voracious reader, and
has her head full of strange tales made up from
books and her own imagination. At one time it seemed impossible to do
anything for her in Chicago, and she was kept for two years in a suburb,
where the family of the charity visitor lived, and where she was nursed
through several hazardous illnesses. She now lives a better life than
she did, but she is still far from being a model old woman. The
neighbors are constantly shocked by the fact that she is supported and
comforted by a "charity lady," while at the same time she occasionally
"rushes the growler," scolding at the boys lest they jar her in her
tottering walk. The care of her has broken through even that second
standard, which the neighborhood had learned to recognize as the
standard of charitable societies, that only the "worthy poor" are to be
helped; that temperance and thrift are the virtues which receive the
plums of benevolence. The old lady herself is conscious of this
criticism. Indeed, irate neighbors tell her to her face that she doesn't
in the least deserve what she gets. In order to
disarm them, and at the same time to explain what would otherwise seem
loving-kindness so colossal as to be abnormal, she tells them that
during her sojourn in the suburb she discovered an awful family
secret,—a horrible scandal connected with the long-suffering charity
visitor; that it is in order to prevent the divulgence of this that she
constantly receives her ministrations. Some of her perplexed neighbors
accept this explanation as simple and offering a solution of this vexed
problem. Doubtless many of them have a glimpse of the real state of
affairs, of the love and patience which ministers to need
irrespective of worth. But the standard is too high for most of them,
and it sometimes seems unfortunate to break down the second standard,
which holds that people who "rush the growler" are not worthy of
charity, and that there is a certain justice attained when they go to
the poorhouse. It is certainly dangerous to break down the lower, unless
the higher is made clear.</p>

<p>Just when our affection becomes large enough to
care for the unworthy among the poor as we would care for the unworthy
among our own kin, is certainly a perplexing question. To say that it
should never be so, is a comment upon our democratic relations to them
which few of us would be willing to make.</p>

<p>Of what use is all this striving and perplexity? Has the experience any
value? It is certainly genuine, for it induces an occasional charity
visitor to live in a tenement house as simply as the other tenants do.
It drives others to give up visiting the poor altogether, because, they
claim, it is quite impossible unless the individual becomes a member of
a sisterhood, which requires, as some of the Roman Catholic sisterhoods
do, that the member first take the vows of obedience and poverty, so
that she can have nothing to give save as it is first given to her, and
thus she is not harassed by a constant attempt at adjustment.</p>

<p>Both the tenement-house resident and the sister
assume to have put themselves upon the industrial level of their
neighbors, although they have left out the most awful element of
poverty, that of imminent fear of starvation and a neglected old age.</p>

<p>The young charity visitor who goes from a family living upon a most
precarious industrial level to her own home in a prosperous part of the
city, if she is sensitive at all, is never free from perplexities which
our growing democracy forces upon her.</p>

<p>We sometimes say that our charity is too scientific, but we would
doubtless be much more correct in our estimate if we said that it is not
scientific enough. We dislike the entire arrangement of cards
alphabetically classified according to streets and names of families,
with the unrelated and meaningless details attached to them. Our feeling
of revolt is probably not unlike that which afflicted the students of
botany and geology in the middle of the last century, when flowers were
tabulated in alphabetical order, when geology
was taught by colored charts and thin books. No doubt the students,
wearied to death, many times said that it was all too scientific, and
were much perplexed and worried when they found traces of structure and
physiology which their so-called scientific principles were totally
unable to account for. But all this happened before science had become
evolutionary and scientific at all, before it had a principle of life
from within. The very indications and discoveries which formerly
perplexed, later illumined and made the study absorbing and vital.</p>

<p>We are singularly slow to apply this evolutionary principle to human
affairs in general, although it is fast being applied to the education
of children. We are at last learning to follow the development of the
child; to expect certain traits under certain conditions; to adapt
methods and matter to his growing mind. No "advanced educator" can allow
himself to be so absorbed in the question of what a child ought to be as to exclude the discovery of what he
is. But in our charitable efforts we think much more of what a man ought
to be than of what he is or of what he may become; and we ruthlessly
force our conventions and standards upon him, with a sternness which we
would consider stupid indeed did an educator use it in forcing his
mature intellectual convictions upon an undeveloped mind.</p>

<p>Let us take the example of a timid child, who cries when he is put to
bed because he is afraid of the dark. The "soft-hearted" parent stays
with him, simply because he is sorry for him and wants to comfort him.
The scientifically trained parent stays with him, because he realizes
that the child is in a stage of development in which his imagination has
the best of him, and in which it is impossible to reason him out of a
belief in ghosts. These two parents, wide apart in point of view, after
all act much alike, and both very differently from the pseudo-scientific
parent, who acts from dogmatic conviction and
is sure he is right. He talks of developing his child's self-respect and
good sense, and leaves him to cry himself to sleep, demanding powers of
self-control and development which the child does not possess. There is
no doubt that our development of charity methods has reached this
pseudo-scientific and stilted stage. We have learned to condemn
unthinking, ill-regulated kind-heartedness, and we take great pride in
mere repression much as the stern parent tells the visitor below how
admirably he is rearing the child, who is hysterically crying upstairs
and laying the foundation for future nervous disorders. The
pseudo-scientific spirit, or rather, the undeveloped stage of our
philanthropy, is perhaps most clearly revealed in our tendency to lay
constant stress on negative action. "Don't give;" "don't break down
self-respect," we are constantly told. We distrust the human impulse as
well as the teachings of our own experience, and in their stead
substitute dogmatic rules for conduct. We
forget that the accumulation of knowledge and the holding of convictions
must finally result in the application of that knowledge and those
convictions to life itself; that the necessity for activity and a pull
upon the sympathies is so severe, that all the knowledge in the
possession of the visitor is constantly applied, and she has a
reasonable chance for an ultimate intellectual comprehension. Indeed,
part of the perplexity in the administration of charity comes from the
fact that the type of person drawn to it is the one who insists that her
convictions shall not be unrelated to action. Her moral concepts
constantly tend to float away from her, unless they have a basis in the
concrete relation of life. She is confronted with the task of reducing
her scruples to action, and of converging many wills, so as to unite the
strength of all of them into one accomplishment, the value of which no
one can foresee.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the young woman who has succeeded in expressing her
social compunction through charitable effort
finds that the wider social activity, and the contact with the larger
experience, not only increases her sense of social obligation but at the
same time recasts her social ideals. She is chagrined to discover that
in the actual task of reducing her social scruples to action, her humble
beneficiaries are far in advance of her, not in charity or singleness of
purpose, but in self-sacrificing action. She reaches the old-time virtue
of humility by a social process, not in the old way, as the man who sits
by the side of the road and puts dust upon his head, calling himself a
contrite sinner, but she gets the dust upon her head because she has
stumbled and fallen in the road through her efforts to push forward the
mass, to march with her fellows. She has socialized her virtues not only
through a social aim but by a social process.</p>

<p>The Hebrew prophet made three requirements from those who would join the
great forward-moving procession led by Jehovah. "To love mercy" and at
the same time "to do justly" is the difficult
task; to fulfil the first requirement alone is to fall into the error of
indiscriminate giving with all its disastrous results; to fulfil the
second solely is to obtain the stern policy of withholding, and it
results in such a dreary lack of sympathy and understanding that the
establishment of justice is impossible. It may be that the combination
of the two can never be attained save as we fulfil still the third
requirement—"to walk humbly with God," which may mean to walk for many
dreary miles beside the lowliest of His creatures, not even in that
peace of mind which the company of the humble is popularly supposed to
afford, but rather with the pangs and throes to which the poor human
understanding is subjected whenever it attempts to comprehend the
meaning of life.</p>


<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h4>FILIAL RELATIONS</h4>

<p>There are many people in every community who have not felt the "social
compunction," who do not share the effort toward a higher social
morality, who are even unable to sympathetically interpret it. Some of
these have been shielded from the inevitable and salutary failures which
the trial of new powers involve, because they are content to attain
standards of virtue demanded by an easy public opinion, and others of
them have exhausted their moral energy in attaining to the current
standard of individual and family righteousness.</p>

<p>Such people, who form the bulk of contented society, demand that the
radical, the reformer, shall be without stain or question in his
personal and family relations, and judge most
harshly any deviation from the established standards. There is a certain
justice in this: it expresses the inherent conservatism of the mass of
men, that none of the established virtues which have been so slowly and
hardly acquired shall be sacrificed for the sake of making problematic
advance; that the individual, in his attempt to develop and use the new
and exalted virtue, shall not fall into the easy temptation of letting
the ordinary ones slip through his fingers.</p>

<p>This instinct to conserve the old standards, combined with a distrust of
the new standard, is a constant difficulty in the way of those
experiments and advances depending upon the initiative of women, both
because women are the more sensitive to the individual and family
claims, and because their training has tended to make them content with
the response to these claims alone.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that, in the effort to sustain the moral energy
necessary to work out a more satisfactory social relation, the individual often sacrifices the energy which
should legitimately go into the fulfilment of personal and family
claims, to what he considers the higher claim.</p>

<p>In considering the changes which our increasing democracy is constantly
making upon various relationships, it is impossible to ignore the filial
relation. This chapter deals with the relation between parents and their
grown-up daughters, as affording an explicit illustration of the
perplexity and mal-adjustment brought about by the various attempts of
young women to secure a more active share in the community life. We
constantly see parents very much disconcerted and perplexed in regard to
their daughters when these daughters undertake work lying quite outside
of traditional and family interests. These parents insist that the girl
is carried away by a foolish enthusiasm, that she is in search of a
career, that she is restless and does not know what she wants. They will
give any reason, almost, rather than the recognition of a genuine and dignified claim. Possibly all this is due to
the fact that for so many hundreds of years women have had no larger
interests, no participation in the affairs lying quite outside personal
and family claims. Any attempt that the individual woman formerly made
to subordinate or renounce the family claim was inevitably construed to
mean that she was setting up her own will against that of her family's
for selfish ends. It was concluded that she could have no motive larger
than a desire to serve her family, and her attempt to break away must
therefore be wilful and self-indulgent.</p>

<p>The family logically consented to give her up at her marriage, when she
was enlarging the family tie by founding another family. It was easy to
understand that they permitted and even promoted her going to college,
travelling in Europe, or any other means of self-improvement, because
these merely meant the development and cultivation of one of its own
members. When, however, she responded to her impulse to fulfil the social or democratic claim, she
violated every tradition.</p>

<p>The mind of each one of us reaches back to our first struggles as we
emerged from self-willed childhood into a recognition of family
obligations. We have all gradually learned to respond to them, and yet
most of us have had at least fleeting glimpses of what it might be to
disregard them and the elemental claim they make upon us. We have
yielded at times to the temptation of ignoring them for selfish aims, of
considering the individual and not the family convenience, and we
remember with shame the self-pity which inevitably followed. But just as
we have learned to adjust the personal and family claims, and to find an
orderly development impossible without recognition of both, so perhaps
we are called upon now to make a second adjustment between the family
and the social claim, in which neither shall lose and both be ennobled.</p>

<p>The attempt to bring about a healing compromise
in which the two shall be adjusted in proper relation is not an easy
one. It is difficult to distinguish between the outward act of him who
in following one legitimate claim has been led into the temporary
violation of another, and the outward act of him who deliberately
renounces a just claim and throws aside all obligation for the sake of
his own selfish and individual development. The man, for instance, who
deserts his family that he may cultivate an artistic sensibility, or
acquire what he considers more fulness of life for himself, must always
arouse our contempt. Breaking the marriage tie as Ibsen's "Nora" did, to
obtain a larger self-development, or holding to it as George Eliot's
"Romola" did, because of the larger claim of the state and society, must
always remain two distinct paths. The collision of interests, each of
which has a real moral basis and a right to its own place in life, is
bound to be more or less tragic. It is the struggle between two claims,
the destruction of either of which would bring
ruin to the ethical life. Curiously enough, it is almost exactly this
contradiction which is the tragedy set forth by the Greek dramatist, who
asserted that the gods who watch over the sanctity of the family bond
must yield to the higher claims of the gods of the state. The failure to
recognize the social claim as legitimate causes the trouble; the
suspicion constantly remains that woman's public efforts are merely
selfish and captious, and are not directed to the general good. This
suspicion will never be dissipated until parents, as well as daughters,
feel the democratic impulse and recognize the social claim.</p>

<p>Our democracy is making inroads upon the family, the oldest of human
institutions, and a claim is being advanced which in a certain sense is
larger than the family claim. The claim of the state in time of war has
long been recognized, so that in its name the family has given up sons
and husbands and even the fathers of little children. If we can once see
the claims of society in any such light, if its
misery and need can be made clear and urged as an explicit claim, as the
state urges its claims in the time of danger, then for the first time
the daughter who desires to minister to that need will be recognized as
acting conscientiously. This recognition may easily come first through
the emotions, and may be admitted as a response to pity and mercy long
before it is formulated and perceived by the intellect.</p>

<p>The family as well as the state we are all called upon to maintain as
the highest institutions which the race has evolved for its safeguard
and protection. But merely to preserve these institutions is not enough.
There come periods of reconstruction, during which the task is laid upon
a passing generation, to enlarge the function and carry forward the
ideal of a long-established institution. There is no doubt that many
women, consciously and unconsciously, are struggling with this task. The
family, like every other element of human life, is susceptible of
progress, and from epoch to epoch its
tendencies and aspirations are enlarged, although its duties can never
be abrogated and its obligations can never be cancelled. It is
impossible to bring about the higher development by any self-assertion
or breaking away of the individual will. The new growth in the plant
swelling against the sheath, which at the same time imprisons and
protects it, must still be the truest type of progress. The family in
its entirety must be carried out into the larger life. Its various
members together must recognize and acknowledge the validity of the
social obligation. When this does not occur we have a most flagrant
example of the ill-adjustment and misery arising when an ethical code is
applied too rigorously and too conscientiously to conditions which are
no longer the same as when the code was instituted, and for which it was
never designed. We have all seen parental control and the family claim
assert their authority in fields of effort which belong to the adult
judgment of the child and pertain to activity
quite outside the family life. Probably the distinctively family tragedy
of which we all catch glimpses now and then, is the assertion of this
authority through all the entanglements of wounded affection and
misunderstanding. We see parents and children acting from conscientious
motives and with the tenderest affection, yet bringing about a misery
which can scarcely be hidden.</p>

<p>Such glimpses remind us of that tragedy enacted centuries ago in Assisi,
when the eager young noble cast his very clothing at his father's feet,
dramatically renouncing his filial allegiance, and formally subjecting
the narrow family claim to the wider and more universal duty. All the
conflict of tragedy ensued which might have been averted, had the father
recognized the higher claim, and had he been willing to subordinate and
adjust his own claim to it. The father considered his son disrespectful
and hard-hearted, yet we know St. Francis to have been the most tender
and loving of men, responsive to all possible
ties, even to those of inanimate nature. We know that by his affections
he freed the frozen life of his time. The elements of tragedy lay in the
narrowness of the father's mind; in his lack of comprehension and his
lack of sympathy with the power which was moving his son, and which was
but part of the religious revival which swept Europe from end to end in
the early part of the thirteenth century; the same power which built the
cathedrals of the North, and produced the saints and sages of the South.
But the father's situation was nevertheless genuine; he felt his heart
sore and angry, and his dignity covered with disrespect. He could not,
indeed, have felt otherwise, unless he had been touched by the fire of
the same revival, and lifted out of and away from the contemplation of
himself and his narrower claim. It is another proof that the notion of a
larger obligation can only come through the response to an enlarged
interest in life and in the social movements
around us.</p>

<p>The grown-up son has so long been considered a citizen with well-defined
duties and a need of "making his way in the world," that the family
claim is urged much less strenuously in his case, and as a matter of
authority, it ceases gradually to be made at all. In the case of the
grown-up daughter, however, who is under no necessity of earning a
living, and who has no strong artistic bent, taking her to Paris to
study painting or to Germany to study music, the years immediately
following her graduation from college are too often filled with a
restlessness and unhappiness which might be avoided by a little clear
thinking, and by an adaptation of our code of family ethics to modern
conditions.</p>

<p>It is always difficult for the family to regard the daughter otherwise
than as a family possession. From her babyhood she has been the charm
and grace of the household, and it is hard to think of her as an integral part of the social order, hard to
believe that she has duties outside of the family, to the state and to
society in the larger sense. This assumption that the daughter is solely
an inspiration and refinement to the family itself and its own immediate
circle, that her delicacy and polish are but outward symbols of her
father's protection and prosperity, worked very smoothly for the most
part so long as her education was in line with it. When there was
absolutely no recognition of the entity of woman's life beyond the
family, when the outside claims upon her were still wholly unrecognized,
the situation was simple, and the finishing school harmoniously and
elegantly answered all requirements. She was fitted to grace the
fireside and to add lustre to that social circle which her parents
selected for her. But this family assumption has been notably broken
into, and educational ideas no longer fit it. Modern education
recognizes woman quite apart from family or society claims, and gives her the training which for many years has been
deemed successful for highly developing a man's individuality and
freeing his powers for independent action. Perplexities often occur when
the daughter returns from college and finds that this recognition has
been but partially accomplished. When she attempts to act upon the
assumption of its accomplishment, she finds herself jarring upon ideals
which are so entwined with filial piety, so rooted in the tenderest
affections of which the human heart is capable, that both daughter and
parents are shocked and startled when they discover what is happening,
and they scarcely venture to analyze the situation. The ideal for the
education of woman has changed under the pressure of a new claim. The
family has responded to the extent of granting the education, but they
are jealous of the new claim and assert the family claim as over against
it.</p>

<p>The modern woman finds herself educated to recognize a stress of social
obligation which her family did not in the
least anticipate when they sent her to college. She finds herself, in
addition, under an impulse to act her part as a citizen of the world.
She accepts her family inheritance with loyalty and affection, but she
has entered into a wider inheritance as well, which, for lack of a
better phrase, we call the social claim. This claim has been recognized
for four years in her training, but after her return from college the
family claim is again exclusively and strenuously asserted. The
situation has all the discomfort of transition and compromise. The
daughter finds a constant and totally unnecessary conflict between the
social and the family claims. In most cases the former is repressed and
gives way to the family claim, because the latter is concrete and
definitely asserted, while the social demand is vague and unformulated.
In such instances the girl quietly submits, but she feels wronged
whenever she allows her mind to dwell upon the situation. She either hides her hurt, and splendid reserves of
enthusiasm and capacity go to waste, or her zeal and emotions are turned
inward, and the result is an unhappy woman, whose heart is consumed by
vain regrets and desires.</p>

<p>If the college woman is not thus quietly reabsorbed, she is even
reproached for her discontent. She is told to be devoted to her family,
inspiring and responsive to her social circle, and to give the rest of
her time to further self-improvement and enjoyment. She expects to do
this, and responds to these claims to the best of her ability, even
heroically sometimes. But where is the larger life of which she has
dreamed so long? That life which surrounds and completes the individual
and family life? She has been taught that it is her duty to share this
life, and her highest privilege to extend it. This divergence between
her self-centred existence and her best convictions becomes constantly
more apparent. But the situation is not even so simple as a conflict between her affections and her
intellectual convictions, although even that is tumultuous enough, also
the emotional nature is divided against itself. The social claim is a
demand upon the emotions as well as upon the intellect, and in ignoring
it she represses not only her convictions but lowers her springs of
vitality. Her life is full of contradictions. She looks out into the
world, longing that some demand be made upon her powers, for they are
too untrained to furnish an initiative. When her health gives way under
this strain, as it often does, her physician invariably advises a rest.
But to be put to bed and fed on milk is not what she requires. What she
needs is simple, health-giving activity, which, involving the use of all
her faculties, shall be a response to all the claims which she so keenly
feels.</p>

<p>It is quite true that the family often resents her first attempts to be
part of a life quite outside their own, because the college woman frequently makes these first
attempts most awkwardly; her faculties have not been trained in the line
of action. She lacks the ability to apply her knowledge and theories to
life itself and to its complicated situations. This is largely the fault
of her training and of the one-sidedness of educational methods. The
colleges have long been full of the best ethical teaching, insisting
that the good of the whole must ultimately be the measure of effort, and
that the individual can only secure his own rights as he labors to
secure those of others. But while the teaching has included an
ever-broadening range of obligation and has insisted upon the
recognition of the claims of human brotherhood, the training has been
singularly individualistic; it has fostered ambitions for personal
distinction, and has trained the faculties almost exclusively in the
direction of intellectual accumulation. Doubtless, woman's education is
at fault, in that it has failed to recognize certain needs, and has
failed to cultivate and guide the larger
desires of which all generous young hearts are full.</p>

<p>During the most formative years of life, it gives the young girl no
contact with the feebleness of childhood, the pathos of suffering, or
the needs of old age. It gathers together crude youth in contact only
with each other and with mature men and women who are there for the
purpose of their mental direction. The tenderest promptings are bidden
to bide their time. This could only be justifiable if a definite outlet
were provided when they leave college. Doubtless the need does not
differ widely in men and women, but women not absorbed in professional
or business life, in the years immediately following college, are baldly
brought face to face with the deficiencies of their training. Apparently
every obstacle is removed, and the college woman is at last free to
begin the active life, for which, during so many years, she has been
preparing. But during this so-called preparation, her faculties have
been trained solely for accumulation, and she
has learned to utterly distrust the finer impulses of her nature, which
would naturally have connected her with human interests outside of her
family and her own immediate social circle. All through school and
college the young soul dreamed of self-sacrifice, of succor to the
helpless and of tenderness to the unfortunate. We persistently distrust
these desires, and, unless they follow well-defined lines, we repress
them with every device of convention and caution.</p>

<p>One summer the writer went from a two weeks' residence in East London,
where she had become sick and bewildered by the sights and sounds
encountered there, directly to Switzerland. She found the beaten routes
of travel filled with young English men and women who could walk many
miles a day, and who could climb peaks so inaccessible that the feats
received honorable mention in Alpine journals,—a result which filled
their families with joy and pride. These young people knew to a nicety the proper diet and clothing which would
best contribute toward endurance. Everything was very fine about them
save their motive power. The writer does not refer to the hard-worked
men and women who were taking a vacation, but to the leisured young
people, to whom this period was the most serious of the year, and filled
with the most strenuous exertion. They did not, of course, thoroughly
enjoy it, for we are too complicated to be content with mere exercise.
Civilization has bound us too closely with our brethren for any one of
us to be long happy in the cultivation of mere individual force or in
the accumulation of mere muscular energy.</p>

<p>With Whitechapel constantly in mind, it was difficult not to advise
these young people to use some of this muscular energy of which they
were so proud, in cleaning neglected alleys and paving soggy streets.
Their stores of enthusiasm might stir to energy the listless men and
women of East London and utilize latent social
forces. The exercise would be quite as good, the need of endurance as
great, the care for proper dress and food as important; but the motives
for action would be turned from selfish ones into social ones. Such an
appeal would doubtless be met with a certain response from the young
people, but would never be countenanced by their families for an
instant.</p>

<p>Fortunately a beginning has been made in another direction, and a few
parents have already begun to consider even their little children in
relation to society as well as to the family. The young mothers who
attend "Child Study" classes have a larger notion of parenthood and
expect given characteristics from their children, at certain ages and
under certain conditions. They quite calmly watch the various attempts
of a child to assert his individuality, which so often takes the form of
opposition to the wishes of the family and to the rule of the household.
They recognize as acting under the same law of development the little
child of three who persistently runs away and
pretends not to hear his mother's voice, the boy of ten who violently,
although temporarily, resents control of any sort, and the grown-up son
who, by an individualized and trained personality, is drawn into
pursuits and interests quite alien to those of his family.</p>

<p>This attempt to take the parental relation somewhat away from mere
personal experience, as well as the increasing tendency of parents to
share their children's pursuits and interests, will doubtless finally
result in a better understanding of the social obligation. The
understanding, which results from identity of interests, would seem to
confirm the conviction that in the complicated life of to-day there is
no education so admirable as that education which comes from
participation in the constant trend of events. There is no doubt that
most of the misunderstandings of life are due to partial intelligence,
because our experiences have been so unlike that we cannot comprehend
each other. The old difficulties incident to
the clash of two codes of morals must drop away, as the experiences of
various members of the family become larger and more identical.</p>

<p>At the present moment, however, many of those difficulties still exist
and may be seen all about us. In order to illustrate the situation
baldly, and at the same time to put it dramatically, it may be well to
take an instance concerning which we have no personal feeling. The
tragedy of King Lear has been selected, although we have been accustomed
so long to give him our sympathy as the victim of the ingratitude of his
two older daughters, and of the apparent coldness of Cordelia, that we
have not sufficiently considered the weakness of his fatherhood,
revealed by the fact that he should get himself into so entangled and
unhappy a relation to all of his children. In our pity for Lear, we fail
to analyze his character. The King on his throne exhibits utter lack of
self-control. The King in the storm gives way
to the same emotion, in repining over the wickedness of his children,
which he formerly exhibited in his indulgent treatment of them.</p>

<p>It might be illuminating to discover wherein he had failed, and why his
old age found him roofless in spite of the fact that he strenuously
urged the family claim with his whole conscience. At the opening of the
drama he sat upon his throne, ready for the enjoyment which an indulgent
parent expects when he has given gifts to his children. From the two
elder, the responses for the division of his lands were graceful and
fitting, but he longed to hear what Cordelia, his youngest and best
beloved child, would say. He looked toward her expectantly, but instead
of delight and gratitude there was the first dawn of character. Cordelia
made the awkward attempt of an untrained soul to be honest and
scrupulously to express her inmost feeling. The king was baffled and
distressed by this attempt at self-expression.
It was new to him that his daughter should be moved by a principle
obtained outside himself, which even his imagination could not follow;
that she had caught the notion of an existence in which her relation as
a daughter played but a part. She was transformed by a dignity which
recast her speech and made it self-contained. She found herself in the
sweep of a feeling so large that the immediate loss of a kingdom seemed
of little consequence to her. Even an act which might be construed as
disrespect to her father was justified in her eyes, because she was
vainly striving to fill out this larger conception of duty. The test
which comes sooner or later to many parents had come to Lear, to
maintain the tenderness of the relation between father and child, after
that relation had become one between adults, to be content with the
responses made by the adult child to the family claim, while at the same
time she responded to the claims of the rest of life. The mind of Lear
was not big enough for this test; he failed to
see anything but the personal slight involved, and the ingratitude alone
reached him. It was impossible for him to calmly watch his child
developing beyond the stretch of his own mind and sympathy.</p>

<p>That a man should be so absorbed in his own indignation as to fail to
apprehend his child's thought, that he should lose his affection in his
anger, simply reveals the fact that his own emotions are dearer to him
than his sense of paternal obligation. Lear apparently also ignored the
common ancestry of Cordelia and himself, and forgot her royal
inheritance of magnanimity. He had thought of himself so long as a noble
and indulgent father that he had lost the faculty by which he might
perceive himself in the wrong. Even in the midst of the storm he
declared himself more sinned against than sinning. He could believe any
amount of kindness and goodness of himself, but could imagine no
fidelity on the part of Cordelia unless she
gave him the sign he demanded.</p>

<p>At length he suffered many hardships; his spirit was buffeted and
broken; he lost his reason as well as his kingdom; but for the first
time his experience was identical with the experience of the men around
him, and he came to a larger conception of life. He put himself in the
place of "the poor naked wretches," and unexpectedly found healing and
comfort. He took poor Tim in his arms from a sheer desire for human
contact and animal warmth, a primitive and genuine need, through which
he suddenly had a view of the world which he had never had from his
throne, and from this moment his heart began to turn toward Cordelia.</p>

<p>In reading the tragedy of King Lear, Cordelia receives a full share of
our censure. Her first words are cold, and we are shocked by her lack of
tenderness. Why should she ignore her father's need for indulgence, and
be unwilling to give him what he so obviously
craved? We see in the old king "the over-mastering desire of being
beloved, selfish, and yet characteristic of the selfishness of a loving
and kindly nature alone." His eagerness produces in us a strange pity
for him, and we are impatient that his youngest and best-beloved child
cannot feel this, even in the midst of her search for truth and her
newly acquired sense of a higher duty. It seems to us a narrow
conception that would break thus abruptly with the past and would assume
that her father had no part in the new life. We want to remind her "that
pity, memory, and faithfulness are natural ties," and surely as much to
be prized as is the development of her own soul. We do not admire the
Cordelia who through her self-absorption deserts her father, as we later
admire the same woman who comes back from France that she may include
her father in her happiness and freer life. The first had selfishly
taken her salvation for herself alone, and it was not until her
conscience had developed in her new life that
she was driven back to her father, where she perished, drawn into the
cruelty and wrath which had now become objective and tragic.</p>

<p>Historically considered, the relation of Lear to his children was
archaic and barbaric, indicating merely the beginning of a family life
since developed. His paternal expression was one of domination and
indulgence, without the perception of the needs of his children, without
any anticipation of their entrance into a wider life, or any belief that
they could have a worthy life apart from him. If that rudimentary
conception of family life ended in such violent disaster, the fact that
we have learned to be more decorous in our conduct does not demonstrate
that by following the same line of theory we may not reach a like
misery.</p>

<p>Wounded affection there is sure to be, but this could be reduced to a
modicum if we could preserve a sense of the relation of the individual
to the family, and of the latter to society, and if we had been given a
code of ethics dealing with these larger
relationships, instead of a code designed to apply so exclusively to
relationships obtaining only between individuals.</p>

<p>Doubtless the clashes and jars which we all feel most keenly are those
which occur when two standards of morals, both honestly held and
believed in, are brought sharply together. The awkwardness and
constraint we experience when two standards of conventions and manners
clash but feebly prefigure this deeper difference.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h4>HOUSEHOLD ADJUSTMENT</h4>

<p>If we could only be judged or judge other people by purity of motive,
life would be much simplified, but that would be to abandon the
contention made in the first chapter, that the processes of life are as
important as its aims. We can all recall acquaintances of whose
integrity of purpose we can have no doubt, but who cause much confusion
as they proceed to the accomplishment of that purpose, who indeed are
often insensible to their own mistakes and harsh in their judgments of
other people because they are so confident of their own inner integrity.</p>

<p>This tendency to be so sure of integrity of purpose as to be
unsympathetic and hardened to the means by which it is accomplished, is
perhaps nowhere so obvious as in the household
itself. It nowhere operates as so constant a force as in the minds of
the women who in all the perplexity of industrial transition are
striving to administer domestic affairs. The ethics held by them are for
the most part the individual and family codes, untouched by the larger
social conceptions.</p>

<p>These women, rightly confident of their household and family integrity
and holding to their own code of morals, fail to see the household in
its social aspect. Possibly no relation has been so slow to respond to
the social ethics which we are now considering, as that between the
household employer and the household employee, or, as it is still
sometimes called, that between mistress and servant.</p>

<p>This persistence of the individual code in relation to the household may
be partly accounted for by the fact that orderly life and, in a sense,
civilization itself, grew from the concentration of interest in one
place, and that moral feeling first became centred in a limited number
of persons. From the familiar proposition that
the home began because the mother was obliged to stay in one spot in
order to cherish the child, we can see a foundation for the belief that
if women are much away from home, the home itself will be destroyed and
all ethical progress endangered.</p>

<p>We have further been told that the earliest dances and social gatherings
were most questionable in their purposes, and that it was, therefore,
the good and virtuous women who first stayed at home, until gradually
the two—the woman who stayed at home and the woman who guarded her
virtue—became synonymous. A code of ethics was thus developed in regard
to woman's conduct, and her duties were logically and carefully limited
to her own family circle. When it became impossible to adequately
minister to the needs of this circle without the help of many people who
did not strictly belong to the family, although they were part of the
household, they were added as aids merely for supplying these needs.
When women were the brewers and bakers, the fullers, dyers, spinners, and weavers, the soap and candle
makers, they administered large industries, but solely from the family
point of view. Only a few hundred years ago, woman had complete control
of the manufacturing of many commodities which now figure so largely in
commerce, and it is evident that she let the manufacturing of these
commodities go into the hands of men, as soon as organization and a
larger conception of their production were required. She felt no
responsibility for their management when they were taken from the home
to the factory, for deeper than her instinct to manufacture food and
clothing for her family was her instinct to stay with them, and by
isolation and care to guard them from evil.</p>

<p>She had become convinced that a woman's duty extended only to her own
family, and that the world outside had no claim upon her. The British
matron ordered her maidens aright, when they were spinning under her own
roof, but she felt no compunction of conscience when the morals and health of young girls were endangered in the
overcrowded and insanitary factories. The code of family ethics was
established in her mind so firmly that it excluded any notion of social
effort.</p>

<p>It is quite possible to accept this explanation of the origin of morals,
and to believe that the preservation of the home is at the foundation of
all that is best in civilization, without at the same time insisting
that the separate preparation and serving of food is an inherent part of
the structure and sanctity of the home, or that those who minister to
one household shall minister to that exclusively. But to make this
distinction seems difficult, and almost invariably the sense of
obligation to the family becomes confused with a certain sort of
domestic management. The moral issue involved in one has become
inextricably combined with the industrial difficulty involved in the
other, and it is at this point that so many perplexed housekeepers,
through the confusion of the two problems, take
a difficult and untenable position.</p>

<p>There are economic as well as ethical reasons for this survival of a
simpler code. The wife of a workingman still has a distinct economic
value to her husband. She cooks, cleans, washes, and mends—services for
which, before his marriage, he paid ready money. The wife of the
successful business or professional man does not do this. He continues
to pay for his cooking, house service, and washing. The mending,
however, is still largely performed by his wife; indeed, the stockings
are pathetically retained and their darning given an exaggerated
importance, as if women instinctively felt that these mended stockings
were the last remnant of the entire household industry, of which they
were formerly mistresses. But one industry, the cooking and serving of
foods to her own family, woman has never relinquished. It has,
therefore, never been organized, either by men or women, and is in an
undeveloped state. Each employer of household
labor views it solely from the family standpoint. The ethics prevailing
in regard to it are distinctly personal and unsocial, and result in the
unique isolation of the household employee.</p>

<p>As industrial conditions have changed, the household has simplified,
from the mediæval affair of journeymen, apprentices, and maidens who
spun and brewed to the family proper; to those who love each other and
live together in ties of affection and consanguinity. Were this process
complete, we should have no problem of household employment. But, even
in households comparatively humble, there is still one alien, one who is
neither loved nor loving.</p>

<p>The modern family has dropped the man who made its shoes, the woman who
spun its clothes, and, to a large extent, the woman who washes them, but
it stoutly refuses to drop the woman who cooks its food and ministers
directly to its individual comfort; it strangely insists that to do that would be to destroy the family life itself.
The cook is uncomfortable, the family is uncomfortable; but it will not
drop her as all her fellow-workers have been dropped, although the cook
herself insists upon it. So far has this insistence gone that every
possible concession is made to retain her. The writer knows an employer
in one of the suburbs who built a bay at the back of her house so that
her cook might have a pleasant room in which to sleep, and another in
which to receive her friends. This employer naturally felt aggrieved
when the cook refused to stay in her bay. Viewed in an historic light,
this employer might quite as well have added a bay to her house for her
shoemaker, and then deemed him ungrateful because he declined to live in
it.</p>

<p>A listener, attentive to a conversation between two employers of
household labor,—and we certainly all have opportunity to hear such
conversations,—would often discover a tone implying that the employer
was abused and put upon; that she was
struggling with the problem solely because she was thus serving her
family and performing her social duties; that otherwise it would be a
great relief to her to abandon the entire situation, and "never have a
servant in her house again." Did she follow this impulse, she would
simply yield to the trend of her times and accept the present system of
production. She would be in line with the industrial organization of her
age. Were she in line ethically, she would have to believe that the
sacredness and beauty of family life do not consist in the processes of
the separate preparation of food, but in sharing the corporate life of
the community, and in making the family the unit of that life.</p>

<p>The selfishness of a modern mistress, who, in her narrow social ethics,
insists that those who minister to the comforts of her family shall
minister to it alone, that they shall not only be celibate, but shall be
cut off, more or less, from their natural social ties, excludes the best
working-people from her service.</p>

<p>A man of dignity and ability is quite willing to
come into a house to tune a piano. Another man of mechanical skill will
come to put up window shades. Another of less skill, but of perfect
independence, will come to clean and relay a carpet. These men would all
resent the situation and consider it quite impossible if it implied the
giving up of their family and social ties, and living under the roof of
the household requiring their services.</p>

<p>The isolation of the household employee is perhaps inevitable so long as
the employer holds her belated ethics; but the situation is made even
more difficult by the character and capacity of the girls who enter this
industry. In any great industrial change the workmen who are permanently
displaced are those who are too dull to seize upon changed conditions.
The workmen who have knowledge and insight, who are in touch with their
time, quickly reorganize.</p>

<p>The general statement may be made that the enterprising girls of the
community go into factories, and the less
enterprising go into households, although there are many exceptions. It
is not a question of skill, of energy, of conscientious work, which will
make a girl rise industrially while she is in the household; she is not
in the rising movement. She is belated in a class composed of the
unprogressive elements of the community, which is recruited constantly
by those from the ranks of the incompetent, by girls who are learning
the language, girls who are timid and slow, or girls who look at life
solely from the savings-bank point of view. The distracted housekeeper
struggles with these unprogressive girls, holding to them not even the
well-defined and independent relation of employer and employed, but the
hazy and constantly changing one of mistress to servant.</p>

<p>The latter relation is changing under pressure from various directions.
In our increasing democracy the notion of personal service is constantly
becoming more distasteful, conflicting, as it does, with the more modern notion of personal dignity. Personal
ministration to the needs of childhood, illness, and old age seem to us
reasonable, and the democratic adjustment in regard to them is being
made. The first two are constantly raised nearer to the level of a
profession, and there is little doubt that the third will soon follow.
But personal ministrations to a normal, healthy adult, consuming the
time and energy of another adult, we find more difficult to reconcile to
our theories of democracy.</p>

<p>A factory employer parts with his men at the factory gates at the end of
a day's work; they go to their homes as he goes to his, in the
assumption that they both do what they want and spend their money as
they please; but this solace of equality outside of working hours is
denied the bewildered employer of household labor.</p>

<p>She is obliged to live constantly in the same house with her employee,
and because of certain equalities in food and shelter she is brought
more sharply face to face with the mental and social inequalities.</p>

<p>The difficulty becomes more apparent as the
character of the work performed by the so-called servant is less
absolutely useful and may be merely time consuming. A kind-hearted woman
who will complacently take an afternoon drive, leaving her cook to
prepare the five courses of a "little dinner for only ten guests," will
not be nearly so comfortable the next evening when she speeds her
daughter to a dance, conscious that her waitress must spend the evening
in dull solitude on the chance that a caller or two may ring the
door-bell.</p>

<p>A conscientious employer once remarked to the writer: "In England it
must be much easier; the maid does not look and dress so like your
daughter, and you can at least pretend that she doesn't like the same
things. But really, my new waitress is quite as pretty and stylish as my
daughter is, and her wistful look sometimes when Mary goes off to a
frolic quite breaks my heart."</p>

<p>Too many employers of domestic service have always been exempt from
manual labor, and therefore constantly impose
exacting duties upon employees, the nature of which they do not
understand by experience; there is thus no curb of rationality imposed
upon the employer's requirements and demands. She is totally unlike the
foreman in a shop, who has only risen to his position by way of having
actually performed with his own hands all the work of the men he
directs. There is also another class of employers of domestic labor, who
grow capricious and over-exacting through sheer lack of larger interests
to occupy their minds; it is equally bad for them and the employee that
the duties of the latter are not clearly defined. Tolstoy contends that
an exaggerated notion of cleanliness has developed among such employers,
which could never have been evolved among usefully employed people. He
points to the fact that a serving man, in order that his hands may be
immaculately clean, is kept from performing the heavier work of the
household, and then is supplied with a tray, upon which to place a card,
in order that even his clean hands may not
touch it; later, even his clean hands are covered with a pair of clean
white gloves, which hold the tray upon which the card is placed.</p>

<p>If it were not for the undemocratic ethics used by the employers of
domestics, much work now performed in the household would be done
outside, as is true of many products formerly manufactured in the feudal
household. The worker in all other trades has complete control of his
own time after the performance of definitely limited services, his wages
are paid altogether in money which he may spend in the maintenance of a
separate home life, and he has full opportunity to organize with the
other workers in his trade.</p>

<p>The domestic employee is retained in the household largely because her
"mistress" fatuously believes that she is thus maintaining the sanctity
of family life.</p>

<p>The household employee has no regular opportunity for meeting other
workers of her trade, and of attaining with them the dignity of a
corporate body. The industrial isolation of the
household employee results, as isolation in a trade must always result,
in a lack of progress in the methods and products of that trade, and a
lack of aspiration and education in the workman. Whether we recognize
this isolation as a cause or not, we are all ready to acknowledge that
household labor has been in some way belated; that the improvements
there have not kept up with the improvement in other occupations. It is
said that the last revolution in the processes of cooking was brought
about by Count Rumford, who died a hundred years ago. This is largely
due to the lack of <i>esprit de corps</i> among the employees, which keeps
them collectively from fresh achievements, as the absence of education
in the individual keeps her from improving her implements.</p>

<p>Under this isolation, not only must one set of utensils serve divers
purposes, and, as a consequence, tend to a lessened volume and lower
quality of work, but, inasmuch as the appliances are not made to perform the fullest work, there is an amount of
capital invested disproportionate to the product when measured by the
achievement in other branches of industry. More important than this is
the result of the isolation upon the worker herself. There is nothing
more devastating to the inventive faculty, nor fatal to a flow of mind
and spirit, than the constant feeling of loneliness and the absence of
that fellowship which makes our public opinion. If an angry foreman
reprimands a girl for breaking a machine, twenty other girls hear him,
and the culprit knows perfectly well their opinion as to the justice or
injustice of her situation. In either case she bears it better for
knowing that, and not thinking it over in solitude. If a household
employee breaks a utensil or a piece of porcelain and is reprimanded by
her employer, too often the invisible jury is the family of the latter,
who naturally uphold her censorious position and intensify the feeling
of loneliness in the employee.</p>

<p>The household employee, in addition to her
industrial isolation, is also isolated socially. It is well to remember
that the household employees for the better quarters of the city and
suburbs are largely drawn from the poorer quarters, which are nothing if
not gregarious. The girl is born and reared in a tenement house full of
children. She goes to school with them, and there she learns to march,
to read, and write in companionship with forty others. When she is old
enough to go to parties, those she attends are usually held in a public
hall and are crowded with dancers. If she works in a factory, she walks
home with many other girls, in much the same spirit as she formerly
walked to school with them. She mingles with the young men she knows, in
frank, economic, and social equality. Until she marries she remains at
home with no special break or change in her family and social life. If
she is employed in a household, this is not true. Suddenly all the
conditions of her life are altered. This change
may be wholesome for her, but it is not easy, and thought of the
savings-bank does not cheer one much, when one is twenty. She is
isolated from the people with whom she has been reared, with whom she
has gone to school, and among whom she expects to live when she marries.
She is naturally lonely and constrained away from them, and the "new
maid" often seems "queer" to her employer's family. She does not care to
mingle socially with the people in whose house she is employed, as the
girl from the country often does, but she surfers horribly from
loneliness.</p>

<p>This wholesome, instinctive dread of social isolation is so strong that,
as every city intelligence-office can testify, the filling of situations
is easier, or more difficult, in proportion as the place offers more or
less companionship. Thus, the easy situation to fill is always the city
house, with five or six employees, shading off into the more difficult
suburban home, with two, and the utterly
impossible lonely country house.</p>

<p>There are suburban employers of household labor who make heroic efforts
to supply domestic and social life to their employees; who take the
domestic employee to drive, arrange to have her invited out
occasionally; who supply her with books and papers and companionship.
Nothing could be more praiseworthy in motive, but it is seldom
successful in actual operation, resulting as it does in a simulacrum of
companionship. The employee may have a genuine friendship for her
employer, and a pleasure in her companionship, or she may not have, and
the unnaturalness of the situation comes from the insistence that she
has, merely because of the propinquity.</p>

<p>The unnaturalness of the situation is intensified by the fact that the
employee is practically debarred by distance and lack of leisure from
her natural associates, and that her employer sympathetically insists
upon filling the vacancy in interests and
affections by her own tastes and friendship. She may or may not succeed,
but the employee should not be thus dependent upon the good will of her
employer. That in itself is undemocratic.</p>

<p>The difficulty is increasing by a sense of social discrimination which
the household employee keenly feels is against her and in favor of the
factory girls, in the minds of the young men of her acquaintance. Women
seeking employment, understand perfectly well this feeling among
mechanics, doubtless quite unjustifiable, but it acts as a strong
inducement toward factory labor. The writer has long ceased to apologize
for the views and opinions of working people, being quite sure that on
the whole they are quite as wise and quite as foolish as the views and
opinions of other people, but that this particularly foolish opinion of
young mechanics is widely shared by the employing class can be easily
demonstrated. The contrast is further accentuated by the better social
position of the factory girl, and the advantages provided for her in the way of lunch clubs, social clubs, and
vacation homes, from which girls performing household labor are
practically excluded by their hours of work, their geographical
situation, and a curious feeling that they are not as interesting as
factory girls.</p>

<p>This separation from her natural social ties affects, of course, her
opportunity for family life. It is well to remember that women, as a
rule, are devoted to their families; that they want to live with their
parents, their brothers and sisters, and kinsfolk, and will sacrifice
much to accomplish this. This devotion is so universal that it is
impossible to ignore it when we consider women as employees. Young
unmarried women are not detached from family claims and requirements as
young men are, and are more ready and steady in their response to the
needs of aged parents and the helpless members of the family. But women
performing labor in households have peculiar difficulties in responding
to their family claims, and are practically
dependent upon their employers for opportunities of even seeing their
relatives and friends.</p>

<p>Curiously enough the same devotion to family life and quick response to
its claims, on the part of the employer, operates against the girl
employed in household labor, and still further contributes to her
isolation.</p>

<p>The employer of household labor, in her zeal to preserve her own family
life intact and free from intrusion, acts inconsistently and grants to
her cook, for instance, but once or twice a week, such opportunity for
untrammelled association with her relatives as the employer's family
claims constantly. This in itself is undemocratic, in that it makes a
distinction between the value of family life for one set of people as
over against another; or, rather, claims that one set of people are of
so much less importance than another, that a valuable side of life
pertaining to them should be sacrificed for the other.</p>

<p>This cannot be defended theoretically, and no doubt much of the talk
among the employers of household labor, that
their employees are carefully shielded and cared for, and that it is so
much better for a girl's health and morals to work in a household than
to work in a factory, comes from a certain uneasiness of conscience, and
from a desire to make up by individual scruple what would be done much
more freely and naturally by public opinion if it had an untrammelled
chance to assert itself. One person, or a number of isolated persons,
however conscientious, cannot perform this office of public opinion.
Certain hospitals in London have contributed statistics showing that
seventy-eight per cent of illegitimate children born there are the
children of girls working in households. These girls are certainly not
less virtuous than factory girls, for they come from the same families
and have had the same training, but the girls who remain at home and
work in factories meet their lovers naturally and easily, their fathers
and brothers know the men, and unconsciously exercise a certain
supervision and a certain direction in their
choice of companionship. The household employees living in another part
of the city, away from their natural family and social ties, depend upon
chance for the lovers whom they meet. The lover may be the young man who
delivers for the butcher or grocer, or the solitary friend, who follows
the girl from her own part of town and pursues unfairly the advantage
which her social loneliness and isolation afford him. There is no
available public opinion nor any standard of convention which the girl
can apply to her own situation.</p>

<p>It would be easy to point out many inconveniences arising from the fact
that the old economic forms are retained when moral conditions which
befitted them have entirely disappeared, but until employers of domestic
labor become conscious of their narrow code of ethics, and make a
distinct effort to break through the status of mistress and servant,
because it shocks their moral sense, there is no chance of even
beginning a reform.</p>

<p>A fuller social and domestic life among household
employees would be steps toward securing their entrance into the larger
industrial organizations by which the needs of a community are most
successfully administered. Many a girl who complains of loneliness, and
who relinquishes her situation with that as her sole excuse, feebly
tries to formulate her sense of restraint and social mal-adjustment. She
sometimes says that she "feels so unnatural all the time." The writer
has known the voice of a girl to change so much during three weeks of
"service" that she could not recognize it when the girl returned to her
home. It alternated between the high falsetto in which a shy child
"speaks a piece" and the husky gulp with which the <i>globus hystericus</i>
is swallowed. The alertness and <i>bonhomie</i> of the voice of the
tenement-house child had totally disappeared. When such a girl leaves
her employer, her reasons are often incoherent and totally
incomprehensible to that good lady, who naturally concludes that she wishes to get away from the
work and back to her dances and giddy life, content, if she has these,
to stand many hours in an insanitary factory. The charge of the employer
is only half a truth. These dances may be the only organized form of
social life which the disheartened employee is able to mention, but the
girl herself, in her discontent and her moving from place to place, is
blindly striving to respond to a larger social life. Her employer thinks
that she should be able to consider only the interests and conveniences
of her employer's family, because the employer herself is holding to a
family outlook, and refuses to allow her mind to take in the larger
aspects of the situation.</p>

<p>Although this household industry survives in the midst of the factory
system, it must, of course, constantly compete with it. Women with
little children, or those with invalids depending upon them, cannot
enter either occupation, and they are practically confined to the sewing
trades; but to all other untrained women
seeking employment a choice is open between these two forms of labor.</p>

<p>There are few women so dull that they cannot paste labels on a box, or
do some form of factory work; few so dull that some perplexed
housekeeper will not receive them, at least for a trial, in her
household. Household labor, then, has to compete with factory labor, and
women seeking employment, more or less consciously compare these two
forms of labor in point of hours, in point of permanency of employment,
in point of wages, and in point of the advantage they afford for family
and social life. Three points are easily disposed of. First, in regard
to hours, there is no doubt that the factory has the advantage. The
average factory hours are from seven in the morning to six in the
evening, with the chance of working overtime in busy seasons. This
leaves most of the evenings and Sundays entirely free. The average hours
of household labor are from six in the morning until eight at night,
with little difference in seasons. There is one
afternoon a week, with an occasional evening, but Sunday is seldom
wholly free. Even these evenings and afternoons take the form of a
concession from the employer. They are called "evenings out," as if the
time really belonged to her, but that she was graciously permitting her
employee to use it. This attitude, of course, is in marked contrast to
that maintained by the factory operative, who, when she works evenings
is paid for "over-time."</p>

<p>Second, in regard to permanency of position, the advantage is found
clearly on the side of the household employee, if she proves in any
measure satisfactory to her employer, for she encounters much less
competition.</p>

<p>Third, in point of wages, the household is again fairly ahead, if we
consider not the money received, but the opportunity offered for saving
money. This is greater among household employees, because they do not
pay board, the clothing required is simpler, and the temptation to spend
money in recreation is less frequent. The
minimum wages paid an adult in household labor may be fairly put at two
dollars and a half a week; the maximum at six dollars, this excluding
the comparatively rare opportunities for women to cook at forty dollars
a month, and the housekeeper's position at fifty dollars a month.</p>

<p>The factory wages, viewed from the savings-bank point of view, may be
smaller in the average, but this is doubtless counterbalanced in the
minds of the employees by the greater chance which the factory offers
for increased wages. A girl over sixteen seldom works in a factory for
less than four dollars a week, and always cherishes the hope of at last
being a forewoman with a permanent salary of from fifteen to twenty-five
dollars a week. Whether she attains this or not, she runs a fair chance
of earning ten dollars a week as a skilled worker. A girl finds it
easier to be content with three dollars a week, when she pays for board,
in a scale of wages rising toward ten dollars, than to be content with four dollars a week and pay no board,
in a scale of wages rising toward six dollars; and the girl well knows
that there are scores of forewomen at sixty dollars a month for one
forty-dollar cook or fifty-dollar housekeeper. In many cases this
position is well taken economically, for, although the opportunity for
saving may be better for the employees in the household than in the
factory, her family saves more when she works in a factory and lives
with them. The rent is no more when she is at home. The two dollars and
a half a week which she pays into the family fund more than covers the
cost of her actual food, and at night she can often contribute toward
the family labor by helping her mother wash and sew.</p>

<p>The fourth point has already been considered, and if the premise in
regard to the isolation of the household employee is well taken, and if
the position can be sustained that this isolation proves the determining
factor in the situation, then certainly an effort should be made to
remedy this, at least in its domestic and
social aspects. To allow household employees to live with their own
families and among their own friends, as factory employees now do, would
be to relegate more production to industrial centres administered on the
factory system, and to secure shorter hours for that which remains to be
done in the household.</p>

<p>In those cases in which the household employees have no family ties,
doubtless a remedy against social isolation would be the formation of
residence clubs, at least in the suburbs, where the isolation is most
keenly felt. Indeed, the beginnings of these clubs are already seen in
the servants' quarters at the summer hotels. In these residence clubs,
the household employee could have the independent life which only one's
own abiding place can afford. This, of course, presupposes a higher
grade of ability than household employees at present possess; on the
other hand, it is only by offering such possibilities that the higher
grades of intelligence can be secured for household employment. As the plan of separate clubs for household
employees will probably come first in the suburbs, where the difficulty
of securing and holding "servants" under the present system is most
keenly felt, so the plan of buying cooked food from an outside kitchen,
and of having more and more of the household product relegated to the
factory, will probably come from the comparatively poor people in the
city, who feel most keenly the pressure of the present system. They
already consume a much larger proportion of canned goods and bakers'
wares and "prepared meats" than the more prosperous people do, because
they cannot command the skill nor the time for the more tedious
preparation of the raw material. The writer has seen a tenement-house
mother pass by a basket of green peas at the door of a local grocery
store, to purchase a tin of canned peas, because they could be easily
prepared for supper and "the children liked the tinny taste."</p>

<p>It is comparatively easy for an employer to manage her household
industry with a cook, a laundress, a waitress.
The difficulties really begin when the family income is so small that
but one person can be employed in the household for all these varied
functions, and the difficulties increase and grow almost insurmountable
as they fall altogether upon the mother of the family, who is living in
a flat, or, worse still, in a tenement house, where one stove and one
set of utensils must be put to all sorts of uses, fit or unfit, making
the living room of the family a horror in summer, and perfectly
insupportable on rainy washing-days in winter. Such a woman, rather than
the prosperous housekeeper, uses factory products, and thus no high
standard of quality is established.</p>

<p>The problem of domestic service, which has long been discussed in the
United States and England, is now coming to prominence in France. As a
well-known economist has recently pointed out, the large defection in
the ranks of domestics is there regarded as a sign of revolt against an
"unconscious slavery," while English and
American writers appeal to the statistics which point to the absorption
of an enormous number of the class from which servants were formerly
recruited into factory employments, and urge, as the natural solution,
that more of the products used in households be manufactured in
factories, and that personal service, at least for healthy adults, be
eliminated altogether. Both of these lines of discussion certainly
indicate that domestic service is yielding to the influence of a
democratic movement, and is emerging from the narrower code of family
ethics into the larger code governing social relations. It still remains
to express the ethical advance through changed economic conditions by
which the actual needs of the family may be supplied not only more
effectively but more in line with associated effort. To fail to
apprehend the tendency of one's age, and to fail to adapt the conditions
of an industry to it, is to leave that industry ill-adjusted and belated
on the economic side, and out of line ethically.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h4>INDUSTRIAL AMELIORATION</h4>

<p>There is no doubt that the great difficulty we experience in reducing to
action our imperfect code of social ethics arises from the fact that we
have not yet learned to act together, and find it far from easy even to
fuse our principles and aims into a satisfactory statement. We have all
been at times entertained by the futile efforts of half a dozen highly
individualized people gathered together as a committee. Their aimless
attempts to find a common method of action have recalled the wavering
motion of a baby's arm before he has learned to coördinate his muscles.</p>

<p>If, as is many times stated, we are passing from an age of individualism
to one of association, there is no doubt that for decisive and effective action the individual still has the
best of it. He will secure efficient results while committees are still
deliberating upon the best method of making a beginning. And yet, if the
need of the times demand associated effort, it may easily be true that
the action which appears ineffective, and yet is carried out upon the
more highly developed line of associated effort, may represent a finer
social quality and have a greater social value than the more effective
individual action. It is possible that an individual may be successful,
largely because he conserves all his powers for individual achievement
and does not put any of his energy into the training which will give him
the ability to act with others. The individual acts promptly, and we are
dazzled by his success while only dimly conscious of the inadequacy of
his code. Nowhere is this illustrated more clearly than in industrial
relations, as existing between the owner of a large factory and his
employees.</p>

<p>A growing conflict may be detected between the
democratic ideal, which urges the workmen to demand representation in
the administration of industry, and the accepted position, that the man
who owns the capital and takes the risks has the exclusive right of
management. It is in reality a clash between individual or aristocratic
management, and corporate or democratic management. A large and highly
developed factory presents a sharp contrast between its socialized form
and individualistic ends.</p>

<p>It is possible to illustrate this difference by a series of events which
occurred in Chicago during the summer of 1894. These events epitomized
and exaggerated, but at the same time challenged, the code of ethics
which regulates much of our daily conduct, and clearly showed that
so-called social relations are often resting upon the will of an
individual, and are in reality regulated by a code of individual
ethics.</p>

<p>As this situation illustrates a point of great
difficulty to which we have arrived in our development of social ethics,
it may be justifiable to discuss it at some length. Let us recall the
facts, not as they have been investigated and printed, but as they
remain in our memories.</p>

<p>A large manufacturing company had provided commodious workshops, and, at
the instigation of its president, had built a model town for the use of
its employees. After a series of years it was deemed necessary, during a
financial depression, to reduce the wages of these employees by giving
each workman less than full-time work "in order to keep the shops open."
This reduction was not accepted by the men, who had become discontented
with the factory management and the town regulations, and a strike
ensued, followed by a complete shut-down of the works. Although these
shops were non-union shops, the strikers were hastily organized and
appealed for help to the American Railway
Union, which at that moment was holding its biennial meeting in Chicago.
After some days' discussion and some futile attempts at arbitration, a
sympathetic strike was declared, which gradually involved railway men in
all parts of the country, and orderly transportation was brought to a
complete standstill. In the excitement which followed, cars were burned
and tracks torn up. The police of Chicago did not cope with the
disorder, and the railway companies, apparently distrusting the Governor
of the State, and in order to protect the United States mails, called
upon the President of the United States for the federal troops, the
federal courts further enjoined all persons against any form of
interference with the property or operation of the railroads, and the
situation gradually assumed the proportions of internecine warfare.
During all of these events the president of the manufacturing company
first involved, steadfastly refused to have the situation submitted to
arbitration, and this attitude naturally
provoked much discussion. The discussion was broadly divided between
those who held that the long kindness of the president of the company
had been most ungratefully received, and those who maintained that the
situation was the inevitable outcome of the social consciousness
developing among working people. The first defended the president of the
company in his persistent refusal to arbitrate, maintaining that
arbitration was impossible after the matter had been taken up by other
than his own employees, and they declared that a man must be allowed to
run his own business. They considered the firm stand of the president a
service to the manufacturing interests of the entire country. The others
claimed that a large manufacturing concern has ceased to be a private
matter; that not only a number of workmen and stockholders are concerned
in its management, but that the interests of the public are so involved
that the officers of the company are in a real
sense administering a public trust.</p>

<p>This prolonged strike clearly puts in a concrete form the ethics of an
individual, in this case a benevolent employer, and the ethics of a mass
of men, his employees, claiming what they believed to be their moral
rights.</p>

<p>These events illustrate the difficulty of managing an industry which has
become organized into a vast social operation, not with the coöperation
of the workman thus socialized, but solely by the dictation of the
individual owning the capital. There is a sharp divergence between the
social form and the individual aim, which becomes greater as the
employees are more highly socialized and dependent. The president of the
company under discussion went further than the usual employer does. He
socialized not only the factory, but the form in which his workmen were
living. He built, and in a great measure regulated, an entire town,
without calling upon the workmen either for
self-expression or self-government. He honestly believed that he knew
better than they what was for their good, as he certainly knew better
than they how to conduct his business. As his factory developed and
increased, making money each year under his direction, he naturally
expected the town to prosper in the same way.</p>

<p>He did not realize that the men submitted to the undemocratic conditions
of the factory organization because the economic pressure in our
industrial affairs is so great that they could not do otherwise. Under
this pressure they could be successfully discouraged from organization,
and systematically treated on the individual basis.</p>

<p>Social life, however, in spite of class distinctions, is much freer than
industrial life, and the men resented the extension of industrial
control to domestic and social arrangements. They felt the lack of
democracy in the assumption that they should be taken care of in these
matters, in which even the humblest workman has
won his independence. The basic difficulty lay in the fact that an
individual was directing the social affairs of many men without any
consistent effort to find out their desires, and without any
organization through which to give them social expression. The president
of the company was, moreover, so confident of the righteousness of his
aim that he had come to test the righteousness of the process by his own
feelings and not by those of the men. He doubtless built the town from a
sincere desire to give his employees the best surroundings. As it
developed, he gradually took toward it the artist attitude toward his
own creation, which has no thought for the creation itself but is
absorbed in the idea it stands for, and he ceased to measure the
usefulness of the town by the standard of the men's needs. This process
slowly darkened his glints of memory, which might have connected his
experience with that of his men. It is possible to cultivate the
impulses of the benefactor until the power of
attaining a simple human relationship with the beneficiaries, that of
frank equality with them, is gone, and there is left no mutual interest
in a common cause. To perform too many good deeds may be to lose the
power of recognizing good in others; to be too absorbed in carrying out
a personal plan of improvement may be to fail to catch the great moral
lesson which our times offer.</p>

<p>The president of this company fostered his employees for many years; he
gave them sanitary houses and beautiful parks; but in their extreme
need, when they were struggling with the most difficult situation which
the times could present to them, he lost his touch and had nothing
wherewith to help them. The employer's conception of goodness for his
men had been cleanliness, decency of living, and, above all, thrift and
temperance. Means had been provided for all this, and opportunities had
also been given for recreation and improvement. But this employer
suddenly found his town in the sweep of a
world-wide moral impulse. A movement had been going on about him and
among his working men, of which he had been unconscious, or concerning
which he had heard only by rumor.</p>

<p>Outside the ken of philanthropists the proletariat had learned to say in
many languages, that "the injury of one is the concern of all." Their
watchwords were brotherhood, sacrifice, the subordination of individual
and trade interests, to the good of the working classes, and they were
moved by a determination to free that class from the untoward conditions
under which they were laboring.</p>

<p>Compared to these watchwords, the old ones which this philanthropic
employer had given his town were negative and inadequate. He had
believed strongly in temperance and steadiness of individual effort, but
had failed to apprehend the greater movement of combined abstinence and
concerted action. With all his fostering, the president had not attained
to a conception of social morality for his men
and had imagined that virtue for them largely meant absence of vice.</p>

<p>When the labor movement finally stirred his town, or, to speak more
fairly, when, in their distress and perplexity, his own employees
appealed to an organized manifestation of this movement, they were quite
sure that simply because they were workmen in distress they would not be
deserted by it. This loyalty on the part of a widely ramified and
well-organized union toward the workmen in a "non-union shop," who had
contributed nothing to its cause, was certainly a manifestation of moral
power.</p>

<p>In none of his utterances or correspondence did the president for an
instant recognize this touch of nobility, although one would imagine
that he would gladly point out this bit of virtue, in what he must have
considered the moral ruin about him. He stood throughout for the
individual virtues, those which had distinguished the model workmen of
his youth; those which had enabled him and so
many of his contemporaries to rise in life, when "rising in life" was
urged upon every promising boy as the goal of his efforts.</p>

<p>Of the code of social ethics he had caught absolutely nothing. The
morals he had advocated in selecting and training his men did not fail
them in the hour of confusion. They were self-controlled, and they
themselves destroyed no property. They were sober and exhibited no
drunkenness, even although obliged to hold their meetings in the saloon
hall of a neighboring town. They repaid their employer in kind, but he
had given them no rule for the life of association into which they were
plunged.</p>

<p>The president of the company desired that his employees should possess
the individual and family virtues, but did nothing to cherish in them
the social virtues which express themselves in associated effort.</p>

<p>Day after day, during that horrible time of suspense, when the wires
constantly reported the same message, "the President of the Company holds that there is nothing to
arbitrate," one was forced to feel that the ideal of one-man rule was
being sustained in its baldest form. A demand from many parts of the
country and from many people was being made for social adjustment,
against which the commercial training and the individualistic point of
view held its own successfully.</p>

<p>The majority of the stockholders, not only of this company but of
similar companies, and many other citizens, who had had the same
commercial experience, shared and sustained this position. It was quite
impossible for them to catch the other point of view. They not only felt
themselves right from the commercial standpoint, but had gradually
accustomed themselves also to the philanthropic standpoint, until they
had come to consider their motives beyond reproach. Habit held them
persistent in this view of the case through all changing conditions.</p>

<p>A wise man has said that "the consent of men
and your own conscience are two wings given you whereby you may rise to
God." It is so easy for the good and powerful to think that they can
rise by following the dictates of conscience, by pursuing their own
ideals, that they are prone to leave those ideals unconnected with the
consent of their fellow-men. The president of the company thought out
within his own mind a beautiful town. He had power with which to build
this town, but he did not appeal to nor obtain the consent of the men
who were living in it. The most unambitious reform, recognizing the
necessity for this consent, makes for slow but sane and strenuous
progress, while the most ambitious of social plans and experiments,
ignoring this, is prone to failure.</p>

<p>The man who insists upon consent, who moves with the people, is bound to
consult the "feasible right" as well as the absolute right. He is often
obliged to attain only Mr. Lincoln's "best possible," and then has the
sickening sense of compromise with his best convictions. He has to move
along with those whom he leads toward a goal
that neither he nor they see very clearly till they come to it. He has
to discover what people really want, and then "provide the channels in
which the growing moral force of their lives shall flow." What he does
attain, however, is not the result of his individual striving, as a
solitary mountain-climber beyond that of the valley multitude but it is
sustained and upheld by the sentiments and aspirations of many others.
Progress has been slower perpendicularly, but incomparably greater
because lateral. He has not taught his contemporaries to climb
mountains, but he has persuaded the villagers to move up a few feet
higher; added to this, he has made secure his progress. A few months
after the death of the promoter of this model town, a court decision
made it obligatory upon the company to divest itself of the management
of the town as involving a function beyond its corporate powers. The
parks, flowers, and fountains of this far-famed industrial centre were dismantled, with scarcely a protest from the
inhabitants themselves.</p>

<p>The man who disassociates his ambition, however disinterested, from the
coöperation of his fellows, always takes this risk of ultimate failure.
He does not take advantage of the great conserver and guarantee of his
own permanent success which associated efforts afford. Genuine
experiments toward higher social conditions must have a more democratic
faith and practice than those which underlie private venture. Public
parks and improvements, intended for the common use, are after all only
safe in the hands of the public itself; and associated effort toward
social progress, although much more awkward and stumbling than that same
effort managed by a capable individual, does yet enlist deeper forces
and evoke higher social capacities.</p>

<p>The successful business man who is also the philanthropist is in more
than the usual danger of getting widely separated from his employees.
The men already have the American veneration
for wealth and successful business capacity, and, added to this, they
are dazzled by his good works. The workmen have the same kindly impulses
as he, but while they organize their charity into mutual benefit
associations and distribute their money in small amounts in relief for
the widows and insurance for the injured, the employer may build model
towns, erect college buildings, which are tangible and enduring, and
thereby display his goodness in concentrated form.</p>

<p>By the very exigencies of business demands, the employer is too often
cut off from the social ethics developing in regard to our larger social
relationships, and from the great moral life springing from our common
experiences. This is sure to happen when he is good "to" people rather
than "with" them, when he allows himself to decide what is best for them
instead of consulting them. He thus misses the rectifying influence of
that fellowship which is so big that it leaves no room for sensitiveness or gratitude. Without this
fellowship we may never know how great the divergence between ourselves
and others may become, nor how cruel the misunderstandings.</p>

<p>During a recent strike of the employees of a large factory in Ohio, the
president of the company expressed himself as bitterly disappointed by
the results of his many kindnesses, and evidently considered the
employees utterly unappreciative. His state of mind was the result of
the fallacy of ministering to social needs from an individual impulse
and expecting a socialized return of gratitude and loyalty. If the
lunch-room was necessary, it was a necessity in order that the employees
might have better food, and, when they had received the better food, the
legitimate aim of the lunch-room was met. If baths were desirable, and
the fifteen minutes of calisthenic exercise given the women in the
middle of each half day brought a needed rest and change to their
muscles, then the increased cleanliness and the increased bodily comfort of so many people should of themselves
have justified the experiment.</p>

<p>To demand, as a further result, that there should be no strikes in the
factory, no revolt against the will of the employer because the
employees were filled with loyalty as the result of the kindness, was of
course to take the experiment from an individual basis to a social one.</p>

<p>Large mining companies and manufacturing concerns are constantly
appealing to their stockholders for funds, or for permission to take a
percentage of the profits, in order that the money may be used for
educational and social schemes designed for the benefit of the
employees. The promoters of these schemes use as an argument and as an
appeal, that better relations will be thus established, that strikes
will be prevented, and that in the end the money returned to the
stockholders will be increased. However praiseworthy this appeal may be
in motive, it involves a distinct confusion of issues, and in theory
deserves the failure it so often meets with in
practice. In the clash which follows a strike, the employees are accused
of an ingratitude, when there was no legitimate reason to expect
gratitude; and useless bitterness, which has really a factitious basis,
may be developed on both sides.</p>

<p>Indeed, unless the relation becomes a democratic one, the chances of
misunderstanding are increased, when to the relation of employer and
employees is added the relation of benefactor to beneficiaries, in so
far as there is still another opportunity for acting upon the individual
code of ethics.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that these efforts are to be commended, not only from
the standpoint of their social value but because they have a marked
industrial significance. Failing, as they do, however, to touch the
question of wages and hours, which are almost invariably the points of
trades-union effort, the employers confuse the mind of the public when
they urge the amelioration of conditions and the kindly relation
existing between them and their men as a reason for the discontinuance
 of strikes and other trades-union tactics. The
men have individually accepted the kindness of the employers as it was
individually offered, but quite as the latter urges his inability to
increase wages unless he has the coöperation of his competitors, so the
men state that they are bound to the trades-union struggle for an
increase in wages because it can only be undertaken by combinations of
labor.</p>

<p>Even the much more democratic effort to divide a proportion of the
profits at the end of the year among the employees, upon the basis of
their wages and efficiency, is also exposed to a weakness, from the fact
that the employing side has the power of determining to whom the benefit
shall accrue.</p>

<p>Both individual acts of self-defence on the part of the wage earner and
individual acts of benevolence on the part of the employer are most
useful as they establish standards to which the average worker and
employer may in time be legally compelled to conform. Progress must
always come through the individual who varies
from the type and has sufficient energy to express this variation. He
first holds a higher conception than that held by the mass of his
fellows of what is righteous under given conditions, and expresses this
conviction in conduct, in many instances formulating a certain scruple
which the others share, but have not yet defined even to themselves.
Progress, however, is not secure until the mass has conformed to this
new righteousness. This is equally true in regard to any advance made in
the standard of living on the part of the trades-unionists or in the
improved conditions of industry on the part of reforming employers. The
mistake lies, not in overpraising the advance thus inaugurated by
individual initiative, but in regarding the achievement as complete in a
social sense when it is still in the realm of individual action. No sane
manufacturer regards his factory as the centre of the industrial system.
He knows very well that the cost of material, wages, and selling prices
are determined by industrial conditions
completely beyond his control. Yet the same man may quite calmly regard
himself and his own private principles as merely self-regarding, and
expect results from casual philanthropy which can only be accomplished
through those common rules of life and labor established by the
community for the common good.</p>

<p>Outside of and surrounding these smaller and most significant efforts
are the larger and irresistible movements operating toward combination.
This movement must tend to decide upon social matters from the social
standpoint. Until then it is difficult to keep our minds free from a
confusion of issues. Such a confusion occurs when the gift of a large
sum to the community for a public and philanthropic purpose, throws a
certain glamour over all the earlier acts of a man, and makes it
difficult for the community to see possible wrongs committed against it,
in the accumulation of wealth so beneficently used. It is possible also
that the resolve to be thus generous
unconsciously influences the man himself in his methods of accumulation.
He keeps to a certain individual rectitude, meaning to make an
individual restitution by the old paths of generosity and kindness,
whereas if he had in view social restitution on the newer lines of
justice and opportunity, he would throughout his course doubtless be
watchful of his industrial relationships and his social virtues.</p>

<p>The danger of professionally attaining to the power of the righteous
man, of yielding to the ambition "for doing good" on a large scale,
compared to which the ambition for politics, learning, or wealth, are
vulgar and commonplace, ramifies through our modern life; and those most
easily beset by this temptation are precisely the men best situated to
experiment on the larger social lines, because they so easily dramatize
their acts and lead public opinion. Very often, too, they have in their
hands the preservation and advancement of large vested interests, and often see clearly and truly that they are
better able to administer the affairs of the community than the
community itself: sometimes they see that if they do not administer them
sharply and quickly, as only an individual can, certain interests of
theirs dependent upon the community will go to ruin.</p>

<p>The model employer first considered, provided a large sum in his will
with which to build and equip a polytechnic school, which will doubtless
be of great public value. This again shows the advantage of individual
management, in the spending as well as in the accumulating of wealth,
but this school will attain its highest good, in so far as it incites
the ambition to provide other schools from public funds. The town of
Zurich possesses a magnificent polytechnic institute, secured by the
vote of the entire people and supported from public taxes. Every man who
voted for it is interested that his child should enjoy its benefits,
and, of course, the voluntary attendance must be larger than in a school accepted as a gift to the
community.</p>

<p>In the educational efforts of model employers, as in other attempts
toward social amelioration, one man with the best of intentions is
trying to do what the entire body of employees should have undertaken to
do for themselves. The result of his efforts will only attain its
highest value as it serves as an incentive to procure other results by
the community as well as for the community.</p>

<p>There are doubtless many things which the public would never demand
unless they were first supplied by individual initiative, both because
the public lacks the imagination, and also the power of formulating
their wants. Thus philanthropic effort supplies kindergartens, until
they become so established in the popular affections that they are
incorporated in the public school system. Churches and missions
establish reading rooms, until at last the public library system dots
the city with branch reading rooms and
libraries. For this willingness to take risks for the sake of an ideal,
for those experiments which must be undertaken with vigor and boldness
in order to secure didactic value in failure as well as in success,
society must depend upon the individual possessed with money, and also
distinguished by earnest and unselfish purpose. Such experiments enable
the nation to use the Referendum method in its public affairs. Each
social experiment is thus tested by a few people, given wide publicity,
that it may be observed and discussed by the bulk of the citizens before
the public prudently makes up its mind whether or not it is wise to
incorporate it into the functions of government. If the decision is in
its favor and it is so incorporated, it can then be carried on with
confidence and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>But experience has shown that we can only depend upon successful men for
a certain type of experiment in the line of industrial amelioration and
social advancement. The list of those who found
churches, educational institutions, libraries, and art galleries, is
very long, as is again the list of those contributing to model
dwellings, recreation halls, and athletic fields. At the present moment
factory employers are doing much to promote "industrial betterment" in
the way of sanitary surroundings, opportunities for bathing, lunch rooms
provided with cheap and wholesome food, club rooms, and guild halls. But
there is a line of social experiment involving social righteousness in
its most advanced form, in which the number of employers and the
"favored class" are so few that it is plain society cannot count upon
them for continuous and valuable help. This lack is in the line of
factory legislation and that sort of social advance implied in shorter
hours and the regulation of wages; in short, all that organization and
activity that is involved in such a maintenance and increase of wages as
would prevent the lowering of the standard of life.</p>

<p>A large body of people feel keenly that the
present industrial system is in a state of profound disorder, and that
there is no guarantee that the pursuit of individual ethics will ever
right it. They claim that relief can only come through deliberate
corporate effort inspired by social ideas and guided by the study of
economic laws, and that the present industrial system thwarts our
ethical demands, not only for social righteousness but for social order.
Because they believe that each advance in ethics must be made fast by a
corresponding advance in politics and legal enactment, they insist upon
the right of state regulation and control. While many people
representing all classes in a community would assent to this as to a
general proposition, and would even admit it as a certain moral
obligation, legislative enactments designed to control industrial
conditions have largely been secured through the efforts of a few
citizens, mostly those who constantly see the harsh conditions of labor
and who are incited to activity by their sympathies as well as their
convictions.</p>

<p> This may be illustrated by the series of legal
enactments regulating the occupations in which children may be allowed
to work, also the laws in regard to the hours of labor permitted in
those occupations, and the minimum age below which children may not be
employed. The first child labor laws were enacted in England through the
efforts of those members of parliament whose hearts were wrung by the
condition of the little parish apprentices bound out to the early
textile manufacturers of the north; and through the long years required
to build up the code of child labor legislation which England now
possesses, knowledge of the conditions has always preceded effective
legislation. The efforts of that small number in every community who
believe in legislative control have always been reënforced by the
efforts of trades-unionists rather than by the efforts of employers.
Partly because the employment of workingmen in the factories brings them
in contact with the children who tend to lower wages and demoralize their trades, and partly because workingmen have
no money nor time to spend in alleviating philanthropy, and must
perforce seize upon agitation and legal enactment as the only channel of
redress which is open to them.</p>

<p>We may illustrate by imagining a row of people seated in a moving
street-car, into which darts a boy of eight, calling out the details of
the last murder, in the hope of selling an evening newspaper. A
comfortable looking man buys a paper from him with no sense of moral
shock; he may even be a trifle complacent that he has helped along the
little fellow, who is making his way in the world. The philanthropic
lady sitting next to him may perhaps reflect that it is a pity that such
a bright boy is not in school. She may make up her mind in a moment of
compunction to redouble her efforts for various newsboys' schools and
homes, that this poor child may have better teaching, and perhaps a
chance at manual training. She probably is convinced that he alone, by his unaided efforts, is
supporting a widowed mother, and her heart is moved to do all she can
for him. Next to her sits a workingman trained in trades-union methods.
He knows that the boy's natural development is arrested, and that the
abnormal activity of his body and mind uses up the force which should go
into growth; moreover, that this premature use of his powers has but a
momentary and specious value. He is forced to these conclusions because
he has seen many a man, entering the factory at eighteen and twenty, so
worn out by premature work that he was "laid on the shelf" within ten or
fifteen years. He knows very well that he can do nothing in the way of
ameliorating the lot of this particular boy; that his only possible
chance is to agitate for proper child-labor laws; to regulate, and if
possible prohibit, street-vending by children, in order that the child
of the poorest may have his school time secured to him, and may have at
least his short chance for growth.</p>

<p> These three people, sitting in the street car,
are all honest and upright, and recognize a certain duty toward the
forlorn children of the community. The self-made man is encouraging one
boy's own efforts; the philanthropic lady is helping on a few boys; the
workingman alone is obliged to include all the boys of his class.
Workingmen, because of their feebleness in all but numbers, have been
forced to appeal to the state, in order to secure protection for
themselves and for their children. They cannot all rise out of their
class, as the occasionally successful man has done; some of them must be
left to do the work in the factories and mines, and they have no money
to spend in philanthropy.</p>

<p>Both public agitation and a social appeal to the conscience of the
community is necessary in order to secure help from the state, and,
curiously enough, child-labor laws once enacted and enforced are a
matter of great pride, and even come to be regarded as a register of the
community's humanity and enlightenment. If the
method of public agitation could find quiet and orderly expression in
legislative enactment, and if labor measures could be submitted to the
examination and judgment of the whole without a sense of division or of
warfare, we should have the ideal development of the democratic state.</p>

<p>But we judge labor organizations as we do other living institutions, not
by their declaration of principles, which we seldom read, but by their
blundering efforts to apply their principles to actual conditions, and
by the oft-time failure of their representatives, when the individual
finds himself too weak to become the organ of corporate action.</p>

<p>The very blunders and lack of organization too often characterizing a
union, in marked contrast to the orderly management of a factory, often
confuse us as to the real issues involved, and we find it hard to trust
uncouth and unruly manifestations of social effort. The situation is
made even more complicated by the fact that
those who are formulating a code of associated action so often break
through the established code of law and order. As society has a right to
demand of the reforming individual that he be sternly held to his
personal and domestic claims, so it has a right to insist that labor
organizations shall keep to the hardly won standards of public law and
order; and the community performs but its plain duty when it registers
its protest every time law and order are subverted, even in the interest
of the so-called social effort. Yet in moments of industrial stress and
strain the community is confronted by a moral perplexity which may arise
from the mere fact that the good of yesterday is opposed to the good of
today, and that which may appear as a choice between virtue and vice is
really but a choice between virtue and virtue. In the disorder and
confusion sometimes incident to growth and progress, the community may
be unable to see anything but the unlovely struggle itself.</p>

<p>The writer recalls a conversation between two
workingmen who were leaving a lecture on "Organic Evolution." The first
was much puzzled, and anxiously inquired of the second "if evolution
could mean that one animal turned into another." The challenged workman
stopped in the rear of the hall, put his foot upon a chair, and
expounded what he thought evolution did mean; and this, so nearly as the
conversation can be recalled, is what he said: "You see a lot of fishes
are living in a stream, which overflows in the spring and strands some
of them upon the bank. The weak ones die up there, but others make a big
effort to get back into the water. They dig their fins into the sand,
breathe as much air as they can with their gills, and have a terrible
time. But after a while their fins turn into legs and their gills into
lungs, and they have become frogs. Of course they are further along than
the sleek, comfortable fishes who sail up and down the stream waving
their tails and despising the poor damaged
things thrashing around on the bank. He—the lecturer—did not say
anything about men, but it is easy enough to think of us poor devils on
the dry bank, struggling without enough to live on, while the
comfortable fellows sail along in the water with all they want and
despise us because we thrash about." His listener did not reply, and was
evidently dissatisfied both with the explanation and the application.
Doubtless the illustration was bungling in more than its setting forth,
but the story is suggestive.</p>

<p>At times of social disturbance the law-abiding citizen is naturally so
anxious for peace and order, his sympathies are so justly and inevitably
on the side making for the restoration of law, that it is difficult for
him to see the situation fairly. He becomes insensible to the unselfish
impulse which may prompt a sympathetic strike in behalf of the workers
in a non-union shop, because he allows his mind to dwell exclusively on
the disorder which has become associated with
the strike. He is completely side-tracked by the ugly phases of a great
moral movement. It is always a temptation to assume that the side which
has respectability, authority, and superior intelligence, has therefore
righteousness as well, especially when the same side presents concrete
results of individual effort as over against the less tangible results
of associated effort.</p>

<p>It is as yet most difficult for us to free ourselves from the
individualistic point of view sufficiently to group events in their
social relations and to judge fairly those who are endeavoring to
produce a social result through all the difficulties of associated
action. The philanthropist still finds his path much easier than do
those who are attempting a social morality. In the first place, the
public, anxious to praise what it recognizes as an undoubted moral
effort often attended with real personal sacrifice, joyfully seizes upon
this manifestation and overpraises it, recognizing the philanthropist as an old friend in the paths of righteousness,
whereas the others are strangers and possibly to be distrusted as
aliens. It is easy to confuse the response to an abnormal number of
individual claims with the response to the social claim. An exaggerated
personal morality is often mistaken for a social morality, and until it
attempts to minister to a social situation its total inadequacy is not
discovered. To attempt to attain a social morality without a basis of
democratic experience results in the loss of the only possible
corrective and guide, and ends in an exaggerated individual morality but
not in social morality at all. We see this from time to time in the
care-worn and overworked philanthropist, who has taxed his individual
will beyond the normal limits and has lost his clew to the situation
among a bewildering number of cases. A man who takes the betterment of
humanity for his aim and end must also take the daily experiences of
humanity for the constant correction of his process. He must not only test and guide his achievement by human
experience, but he must succeed or fail in proportion as he has
incorporated that experience with his own. Otherwise his own
achievements become his stumbling-block, and he comes to believe in his
own goodness as something outside of himself. He makes an exception of
himself, and thinks that he is different from the rank and file of his
fellows. He forgets that it is necessary to know of the lives of our
contemporaries, not only in order to believe in their integrity, which
is after all but the first beginnings of social morality, but in order
to attain to any mental or moral integrity for ourselves or any such
hope for society.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h4>EDUCATIONAL METHODS</h4>

<p>As democracy modifies our conception of life, it constantly raises the
value and function of each member of the community, however humble he
may be. We have come to believe that the most "brutish man" has a value
in our common life, a function to perform which can be fulfilled by no
one else. We are gradually requiring of the educator that he shall free
the powers of each man and connect him with the rest of life. We ask
this not merely because it is the man's right to be thus connected, but
because we have become convinced that the social order cannot afford to
get along without his special contribution. Just as we have come to
resent all hindrances which keep us from untrammelled comradeship with
 our fellows, and as we throw down unnatural
divisions, not in the spirit of the eighteenth-century reformers, but in
the spirit of those to whom social equality has become a necessity for
further social development, so we are impatient to use the dynamic power
residing in the mass of men, and demand that the educator free that
power. We believe that man's moral idealism is the constructive force of
progress, as it has always been; but because every human being is a
creative agent and a possible generator of fine enthusiasm, we are
sceptical of the moral idealism of the few and demand the education of
the many, that there may be greater freedom, strength, and subtilty of
intercourse and hence an increase of dynamic power. We are not content
to include all men in our hopes, but have become conscious that all men
are hoping and are part of the same movement of which we are a part.</p>

<p>Many people impelled by these ideas have become impatient with the slow
recognition on the part of the educators of
their manifest obligation to prepare and nourish the child and the
citizen for social relations. The educators should certainly conserve
the learning and training necessary for the successful individual and
family life, but should add to that a preparation for the enlarged
social efforts which our increasing democracy requires. The democratic
ideal demands of the school that it shall give the child's own
experience a social value; that it shall teach him to direct his own
activities and adjust them to those of other people. We are not willing
that thousands of industrial workers shall put all of their activity and
toil into services from which the community as a whole reaps the
benefit, while their mental conceptions and code of morals are narrow
and untouched by any uplift which the consciousness of social value
might give them.</p>

<p>We are impatient with the schools which lay all stress on reading and
writing, suspecting them to rest upon the assumption that the ordinary experience of life is worth
little, and that all knowledge and interest must be brought to the
children through the medium of books. Such an assumption fails to give
the child any clew to the life about him, or any power to usefully or
intelligently connect himself with it. This may be illustrated by
observations made in a large Italian colony situated in Chicago, the
children from which are, for the most part, sent to the public schools.</p>

<p>The members of the Italian colony are largely from South
Italy,—Calabrian and Sicilian peasants, or Neapolitans from the
workingmen's quarters of that city. They have come to America with the
distinct aim of earning money, and finding more room for the energies of
themselves and their children. In almost all cases they mean to go back
again, simply because their imaginations cannot picture a continuous
life away from the old surroundings. Their experiences in Italy have
been those of simple outdoor activity, and their ideas have come directly to them from their struggle with
Nature,—such a hand-to-hand struggle as takes place when each man gets
his living largely through his own cultivation of the soil, or with
tools simply fashioned by his own hands. The women, as in all primitive
life, have had more diversified activities than the men. They have
cooked, spun, and knitted, in addition to their almost equal work in the
fields. Very few of the peasant men or women can either read or write.
They are devoted to their children, strong in their family feeling, even
to remote relationships, and clannish in their community life.</p>

<p>The entire family has been upheaved, and is striving to adjust itself to
its new surroundings. The men, for the most part, work on railroad
extensions through the summer, under the direction of a <i>padrone</i>, who
finds the work for them, regulates the amount of their wages, and
supplies them with food. The first effect of immigration upon the women
is that of idleness. They no longer work in the
fields, nor milk the goats, nor pick up faggots. The mother of the
family buys all the clothing, not only already spun and woven but made
up into garments, of a cut and fashion beyond her powers. It is, indeed,
the most economical thing for her to do. Her house-cleaning and cooking
are of the simplest; the bread is usually baked outside of the house,
and the macaroni bought prepared for boiling. All of those outdoor and
domestic activities, which she would naturally have handed on to her
daughters, have slipped away from her. The domestic arts are gone, with
their absorbing interests for the children, their educational value, and
incentive to activity. A household in a tenement receives almost no raw
material. For the hundreds of children who have never seen wheat grow,
there are dozens who have never seen bread baked. The occasional
washings and scrubbings are associated only with discomfort. The child
of such a family receives constant stimulus of most exciting sort from
his city street life, but he has little or no
opportunity to use his energies in domestic manufacture, or, indeed,
constructively in any direction. No activity is supplied to take the
place of that which, in Italy, he would naturally have found in his own
surroundings, and no new union with wholesome life is made for him.</p>

<p>Italian parents count upon the fact that their children learn the
English language and American customs before they do themselves, and the
children act not only as interpreters of the language, but as buffers
between them and Chicago, resulting in a certain almost pathetic
dependence of the family upon the child. When a child of the family,
therefore, first goes to school, the event is fraught with much
significance to all the others. The family has no social life in any
structural form and can supply none to the child. He ought to get it in
the school and give it to his family, the school thus becoming the
connector with the organized society about
them. It is the children aged six, eight, and ten, who go to school,
entering, of course, the primary grades. If a boy is twelve or thirteen
on his arrival in America, his parents see in him a wage-earning factor,
and the girl of the same age is already looking toward her marriage.</p>

<p>Let us take one of these boys, who has learned in his six or eight years
to speak his native language, and to feel himself strongly identified
with the fortunes of his family. Whatever interest has come to the minds
of his ancestors has come through the use of their hands in the open
air; and open air and activity of body have been the inevitable
accompaniments of all their experiences. Yet the first thing that the
boy must do when he reaches school is to sit still, at least part of the
time, and he must learn to listen to what is said to him, with all the
perplexity of listening to a foreign tongue. He does not find this very
stimulating, and is slow to respond to the more subtle incentives of the
schoolroom. The peasant child is perfectly
indifferent to showing off and making a good recitation. He leaves all
that to his schoolfellows, who are more sophisticated and equipped with
better English. His parents are not deeply interested in keeping him in
school, and will not hold him there against his inclination. Their
experience does not point to the good American tradition that it is the
educated man who finally succeeds. The richest man in the Italian colony
can neither read nor write—even Italian. His cunning and
acquisitiveness, combined with the credulity and ignorance of his
countrymen, have slowly brought about his large fortune. The child
himself may feel the stirring of a vague ambition to go on until he is
as the other children are; but he is not popular with his schoolfellows,
and he sadly feels the lack of dramatic interest. Even the pictures and
objects presented to him, as well as the language, are strange.</p>

<p>If we admit that in education it is necessary to begin with the
experiences which the child already has and to
use his spontaneous and social activity, then the city streets begin
this education for him in a more natural way than does the school. The
South Italian peasant comes from a life of picking olives and oranges,
and he easily sends his children out to pick up coal from railroad
tracks, or wood from buildings which have been burned down.
Unfortunately, this process leads by easy transition to petty thieving.
It is easy to go from the coal on the railroad track to the coal and
wood which stand before a dealer's shop; from the potatoes which have
rolled from a rumbling wagon to the vegetables displayed by the grocer.
This is apt to be the record of the boy who responds constantly to the
stimulus and temptations of the street, although in the beginning his
search for bits of food and fuel was prompted by the best of motives.</p>

<p>The school has to compete with a great deal from the outside in addition
to the distractions of the neighborhood. Nothing is more fascinating than that mysterious "down
town," whither the boy longs to go to sell papers and black boots, to
attend theatres, and, if possible, to stay all night on the pretence of
waiting for the early edition of the great dailies. If a boy is once
thoroughly caught in these excitements, nothing can save him from
over-stimulation and consequent debility and worthlessness; he arrives
at maturity with no habits of regular work and with a distaste for its
dulness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are hundreds of boys of various nationalities
who conscientiously remain in school and fulfil all the requirements of
the early grades, and at the age of fourteen are found in factories,
painstakingly performing their work year after year. These later are the
men who form the mass of the population in every industrial neighborhood
of every large city; but they carry on the industrial processes year
after year without in the least knowing what it is all about. The one
fixed habit which the boy carries away with him
from the school to the factory is the feeling that his work is merely
provisional. In school the next grade was continually held before him as
an object of attainment, and it resulted in the conviction that the sole
object of present effort is to get ready for something else. This
tentative attitude takes the last bit of social stimulus out of his
factory work; he pursues it merely as a necessity, and his very mental
attitude destroys his chance for a realization of its social value. As
the boy in school contracted the habit of doing his work in certain
hours and taking his pleasure in certain other hours, so in the factory
he earns his money by ten hours of dull work and spends it in three
hours of lurid and unprofitable pleasure in the evening. Both in the
school and in the factory, in proportion as his work grows dull and
monotonous, his recreation must become more exciting and stimulating.
The hopelessness of adding evening classes and social entertainments as
a mere frill to a day filled with monotonous and deadening drudgery constantly becomes more apparent to those
who are endeavoring to bring a fuller life to the industrial members of
the community, and who are looking forward to a time when work shall
cease to be senseless drudgery with no self-expression on the part of
the worker. It sometimes seems that the public schools should contribute
much more than they do to the consummation of this time. If the army of
school children who enter the factories every year possessed thoroughly
vitalized faculties, they might do much to lighten this incubus of dull
factory work which presses so heavily upon so large a number of our
fellow-citizens. Has our commercialism been so strong that our schools
have become insensibly commercialized, whereas we supposed that our
industrial life was receiving the broadening and illuminating effects of
the schools? The training of these children, so far as it has been
vocational at all, has been in the direction of clerical work. It is
possible that the business men, whom we in
America so tremendously admire, have really been dictating the
curriculum of our public schools, in spite of the conventions of
educators and the suggestions of university professors. The business
man, of course, has not said, "I will have the public schools train
office boys and clerks so that I may have them easily and cheaply," but
he has sometimes said, "Teach the children to write legibly and to
figure accurately and quickly; to acquire habits of punctuality and
order; to be prompt to obey; and you will fit them to make their way in
the world as I have made mine." Has the workingman been silent as to
what he desires for his children, and allowed the business man to decide
for him there, as he has allowed the politician to manage his municipal
affairs, or has the workingman so far shared our universal optimism that
he has really believed that his children would never need to go into
industrial life at all, but that all of his sons would become bankers
and merchants?</p>

<p>Certain it is that no sufficient study has been
made of the child who enters into industrial life early and stays there
permanently, to give him some offset to its monotony and dulness, some
historic significance of the part he is taking in the life of the
community.</p>

<p>It is at last on behalf of the average workingmen that our increasing
democracy impels us to make a new demand upon the educator. As the
political expression of democracy has claimed for the workingman the
free right of citizenship, so a code of social ethics is now insisting
that he shall be a conscious member of society, having some notion of
his social and industrial value.</p>

<p>The early ideal of a city that it was a market-place in which to
exchange produce, and a mere trading-post for merchants, apparently
still survives in our minds and is constantly reflected in our schools.
We have either failed to realize that cities have become great centres
of production and manufacture in which a huge population is engaged, or we have lacked sufficient presence of
mind to adjust ourselves to the change. We admire much more the men who
accumulate riches, and who gather to themselves the results of industry,
than the men who actually carry forward industrial processes; and, as
has been pointed out, our schools still prepare children almost
exclusively for commercial and professional life.</p>

<p>Quite as the country boy dreams of leaving the farm for life in town and
begins early to imitate the travelling salesman in dress and manner, so
the school boy within the town hopes to be an office boy, and later a
clerk or salesman, and looks upon work in the factory as the occupation
of ignorant and unsuccessful men. The schools do so little really to
interest the child in the life of production, or to excite his ambition
in the line of industrial occupation, that the ideal of life, almost
from the very beginning, becomes not an absorbing interest in one's work
and a consciousness of its value and social relation, but a desire for
money with which unmeaning purchases may be
made and an unmeaning social standing obtained.</p>

<p>The son of a workingman who is successful in commercial life, impresses
his family and neighbors quite as does the prominent city man when he
comes back to dazzle his native town. The children of the working people
learn many useful things in the public schools, but the commercial
arithmetic, and many other studies, are founded on the tacit assumption
that a boy rises in life by getting away from manual labor,—that every
promising boy goes into business or a profession. The children destined
for factory life are furnished with what would be most useful under
other conditions, quite as the prosperous farmer's wife buys a
folding-bed for her huge four-cornered "spare room," because her sister,
who has married a city man, is obliged to have a folding-bed in the
cramped limits of her flat Partly because so little is done for him
educationally, and partly because he must live narrowly and dress
meanly, the life of the average laborer tends
to become flat and monotonous, with nothing in his work to feed his mind
or hold his interest. Theoretically, we would all admit that the man at
the bottom, who performs the meanest and humblest work, so long as the
work is necessary, performs a useful function; but we do not live up to
our theories, and in addition to his hard and uninteresting work he is
covered with a sort of contempt, and unless he falls into illness or
trouble, he receives little sympathy or attention. Certainly no serious
effort is made to give him a participation in the social and industrial
life with which he comes in contact, nor any insight and inspiration
regarding it.</p>

<p>Apparently we have not yet recovered manual labor from the deep distrust
which centuries of slavery and the feudal system have cast upon it. To
get away from menial work, to do obviously little with one's hands, is
still the desirable status. This may readily be seen all along the line.
A workingman's family will make every effort and sacrifice that the brightest daughter be sent to
the high school and through the normal school, quite as much because a
teacher in the family raises the general social standing and sense of
family consequence, as that the returns are superior to factory or even
office work. "Teacher" in the vocabulary of many children is a synonym
for women-folk gentry, and the name is indiscriminately applied to women
of certain dress and manner. The same desire for social advancement is
expressed by the purchasing of a piano, or the fact that the son is an
office boy, and not a factory hand. The overcrowding of the professions
by poorly equipped men arises from much the same source, and from the
conviction that "an education" is wasted if a boy goes into a factory or
shop.</p>

<p>A Chicago manufacturer tells a story of twin boys, whom he befriended
and meant to give a start in life. He sent them both to the Athenæum for
several winters as a preparatory business training, and then took them
into his office, where they speedily became
known as the bright one and the stupid one. The stupid one was finally
dismissed after repeated trials, when to the surprise of the entire
establishment, he quickly betook himself into the shops, where he became
a wide-awake and valuable workman. His chagrined benefactor, in telling
the story, admits that he himself had fallen a victim to his own
business training and his early notion of rising in life. In reality he
had merely followed the lead of most benevolent people who help poor
boys. They test the success of their efforts by the number whom they
have taken out of factory work into some other and "higher occupation."</p>

<p>Quite in line with this commercial ideal are the night schools and
institutions of learning most accessible to working people. First among
them is the business college which teaches largely the mechanism of
type-writing and book-keeping, and lays all stress upon commerce and
methods of distribution. Commodities are treated as exports and imports, or solely in regard to their
commercial value, and not, of course, in relation to their historic
development or the manufacturing processes to which they have been
subjected. These schools do not in the least minister to the needs of
the actual factory employee, who is in the shop and not in the office.
We assume that all men are searching for "puddings and power," to use
Carlyle's phrase, and furnish only the schools which help them to those
ends.</p>

<p>The business college man, or even the man who goes through an academic
course in order to prepare for a profession, comes to look on learning
too much as an investment from which he will later reap the benefits in
earning money. He does not connect learning with industrial pursuits,
nor does he in the least lighten or illuminate those pursuits for those
of his friends who have not risen in life. "It is as though nets were
laid at the entrance to education, in which those who by some means or other escape from the masses bowed down
by labor, are inevitably caught and held from substantial service to
their fellows." The academic teaching which is accessible to workingmen
through University Extension lectures and classes at settlements, is
usually bookish and remote, and concerning subjects completely divorced
from their actual experiences. The men come to think of learning as
something to be added to the end of a hard day's work, and to be gained
at the cost of toilsome mental exertion. There are, of course,
exceptions, but many men who persist in attending classes and lectures
year after year find themselves possessed of a mass of inert knowledge
which nothing in their experience fuses into availability or
realization.</p>

<p>Among the many disappointments which the settlement experiment has
brought to its promoters, perhaps none is keener than the fact that they
have as yet failed to work out methods of education, specialized and adapted to the needs of adult working people
in contra-distinction to those employed in schools and colleges, or
those used in teaching children. There are many excellent reasons and
explanations for this failure. In the first place, the residents
themselves are for the most part imbued with academic methods and
ideals, which it is most difficult to modify. To quote from a late
settlement report, "The most vaunted educational work in settlements
amounts often to the stimulation mentally of a select few who are, in a
sense, of the academic type of mind, and who easily and quickly respond
to the academic methods employed." These classes may be valuable, but
they leave quite untouched the great mass of the factory population, the
ordinary workingman of the ordinary workingman's street, whose attitude
is best described as that of "acquiescence," who lives through the
aimless passage of the years without incentive "to imagine, to design,
or to aspire." These men are totally untouched
by all the educational and philanthropic machinery which is designed for
the young and the helpless who live on the same streets with them. They
do not often drink to excess, they regularly give all their wages to
their wives, they have a vague pride in their superior children; but
they grow prematurely old and stiff in all their muscles, and become
more and more taciturn, their entire energies consumed in "holding a
job."</p>

<p>Various attempts have been made to break through the inadequate
educational facilities supplied by commercialism and scholarship, both
of which have followed their own ideals and have failed to look at the
situation as it actually presents itself. The most noteworthy attempt
has been the movement toward industrial education, the agitation for
which has been ably seconded by manufacturers of a practical type, who
have from time to time founded and endowed technical schools, designed
for workingmen's sons. The early schools of this type inevitably reflected the ideal of the
self-made man. They succeeded in transferring a few skilled workers into
the upper class of trained engineers, and a few less skilled workers
into the class of trained mechanics, but did not aim to educate the many
who are doomed to the unskilled work which the permanent specialization
of the division of labor demands.</p>

<p>The Peter Coopers and other good men honestly believed that if
intelligence could be added to industry, each workingman who faithfully
attended these schools could walk into increased skill and wages, and in
time even become an employer himself. Such schools are useful beyond
doubt; but so far as educating workingmen is concerned or in any measure
satisfying the democratic ideal, they plainly beg the question.</p>

<p>Almost every large city has two or three polytechnic institutions
founded by rich men, anxious to help "poor boys." These have been
captured by conventional educators for the
purpose of fitting young men for the colleges and universities. They
have compromised by merely adding to the usual academic course manual
work, applied mathematics, mechanical drawing and engineering. Two
schools in Chicago, plainly founded for the sons of workingmen, afford
an illustration of this tendency and result. On the other hand, so far
as schools of this type have been captured by commercialism, they turn
out trained engineers, professional chemists, and electricians. They are
polytechnics of a high order, but do not even pretend to admit the
workingman with his meagre intellectual equipment. They graduate machine
builders, but not educated machine tenders. Even the textile schools are
largely seized by young men who expect to be superintendents of
factories, designers, or manufacturers themselves, and the textile
worker who actually "holds the thread" is seldom seen in them; indeed,
in one of the largest schools women are not allowed, in spite of the
fact that spinning and weaving have
traditionally been woman's work, and that thousands of women are at
present employed in the textile mills.</p>

<p>It is much easier to go over the old paths of education with "manual
training" thrown in, as it were; it is much simpler to appeal to the old
ambitions of "getting on in life," or of "preparing for a profession,"
or "for a commercial career," than to work out new methods on democratic
lines. These schools gradually drop back into the conventional courses,
modified in some slight degree, while the adaptation to workingmen's
needs is never made, nor, indeed, vigorously attempted. In the meantime,
the manufacturers continually protest that engineers, especially trained
for devising machines, are not satisfactory. Three generations of
workers have invented, but we are told that invention no longer goes on
in the workshop, even when it is artificially stimulated by the offer of
prizes, and that the inventions of the last quarter of the nineteenth
century have by no means fulfilled the promise
of the earlier three-quarters.</p>

<p>Every foreman in a large factory has had experience with two classes of
men: first with those who become rigid and tolerate no change in their
work, partly because they make more money "working by the piece," when
they stick to that work which they have learned to do rapidly, and
partly because the entire muscular and nervous system has become by
daily use adapted to particular motions and resents change. Secondly,
there are the men who float in and out of the factory, in a constantly
changing stream. They "quit work" for the slightest reason or none at
all, and never become skilled at anything. Some of them are men of low
intelligence, but many of them are merely too nervous and restless, too
impatient, too easily "driven to drink," to be of any use in a modern
factory. They are the men for whom the demanded adaptation is
impossible.</p>

<p>The individual from whom the industrial order
demands ever larger drafts of time and energy, should be nourished and
enriched from social sources, in proportion as he is drained. He, more
than other men, needs the conception of historic continuity in order to
reveal to him the purpose and utility of his work, and he can only be
stimulated and dignified as he obtains a conception of his proper
relation to society. Scholarship is evidently unable to do this for him;
for, unfortunately, the same tendency to division of labor has also
produced over-specialization in scholarship, with the sad result that
when the scholar attempts to minister to a worker, he gives him the
result of more specialization rather than an offset from it. He cannot
bring healing and solace because he himself is suffering from the same
disease. There is indeed a deplorable lack of perception and adaptation
on the part of educators all along the line.</p>

<p>It will certainly be embarrassing to have our age written down
triumphant in the matter of inventions, in that our factories were filled with intricate machines, the result of
advancing mathematical and mechanical knowledge in relation to
manufacturing processes, but defeated in that it lost its head over the
achievement and forgot the men. The accusation would stand, that the age
failed to perform a like service in the extension of history and art to
the factory employees who ran the machines; that the machine tenders,
heavy and almost dehumanized by monotonous toil, walked about in the
same streets with us, and sat in the same cars; but that we were
absolutely indifferent and made no genuine effort to supply to them the
artist's perception or student's insight, which alone could fuse them
into social consciousness. It would further stand that the scholars
among us continued with yet more research, that the educators were
concerned only with the young and the promising, and the philanthropists
with the criminals and helpless.</p>

<p>There is a pitiful failure to recognize the situation in which the
majority of working people are placed, a
tendency to ignore their real experiences and needs, and, most stupid of
all, we leave quite untouched affections and memories which would afford
a tremendous dynamic if they were utilized.</p>

<p>We constantly hear it said in educational circles, that a child learns
only by "doing," and that education must proceed "through the eyes and
hands to the brain"; and yet for the vast number of people all around us
who do not need to have activities artificially provided, and who use
their hands and eyes all the time, we do not seem able to reverse the
process. We quote the dictum, "What is learned in the schoolroom must be
applied in the workshop," and yet the skill and handicraft constantly
used in the workshop have no relevance or meaning given to them by the
school; and when we do try to help the workingman in an educational way,
we completely ignore his everyday occupation. Yet the task is merely one
of adaptation. It is to take actual conditions and to make them the basis for a large and generous method of
education, to perform a difficult idealization doubtless, but not an
impossible one.</p>

<p>We apparently believe that the workingman has no chance to realize life
through his vocation. We easily recognize the historic association in
regard to ancient buildings. We say that "generation after generation
have stamped their mark upon them, have recorded their thoughts in them,
until they have become the property of all." And yet this is even more
true of the instruments of labor, which have constantly been held in
human hands. A machine really represents the "seasoned life of man"
preserved and treasured up within itself, quite as much as an ancient
building does. At present, workmen are brought in contact with the
machinery with which they work as abruptly as if the present set of
industrial implements had been newly created. They handle the machinery
day by day, without any notion of its gradual evolution and growth. Few
of the men who perform the mechanical work in
the great factories have any comprehension of the fact that the
inventions upon which the factory depends, the instruments which they
use, have been slowly worked out, each generation using the gifts of the
last and transmitting the inheritance until it has become a social
possession. This can only be understood by a man who has obtained some
idea of social progress. We are still childishly pleased when we see the
further subdivision of labor going on, because the quantity of the
output is increased thereby, and we apparently are unable to take our
attention away from the product long enough to really focus it upon the
producer. Theoretically, "the division of labor" makes men more
interdependent and human by drawing them together into a unity of
purpose. "If a number of people decide to build a road, and one digs,
and one brings stones, and another breaks them, they are quite
inevitably united by their interest in the road. But this naturally
presupposes that they know where the road is going to, that they have some curiosity and interest about it,
and perhaps a chance to travel upon it." If the division of labor robs
them of interest in any part of it, the mere mechanical fact of
interdependence amounts to nothing.</p>

<p>The man in the factory, as well as the man with the hoe, has a grievance
beyond being overworked and disinherited, in that he does not know what
it is all about. We may well regret the passing of the time when the
variety of work performed in the unspecialized workshop naturally
stimulated the intelligence of the workingmen and brought them into
contact both with the raw material and the finished product. But the
problem of education, as any advanced educator will tell us, is to
supply the essentials of experience by a short cut, as it were. If the
shop constantly tends to make the workman a specialist, then the problem
of the educator in regard to him is quite clear: it is to give him what
may be an offset from the over-specialization of his daily work, to
supply him with general information and to
insist that he shall be a cultivated member of society with a
consciousness of his industrial and social value.</p>

<p>As sad a sight as an old hand-loom worker in a factory attempting to
make his clumsy machine compete with the flying shuttles about him, is a
workingman equipped with knowledge so meagre that he can get no meaning
into his life nor sequence between his acts and the far-off results.</p>

<p>Manufacturers, as a whole, however, when they attempt educational
institutions in connection with their factories, are prone to follow
conventional lines, and to exhibit the weakness of imitation. We find,
indeed, that the middle-class educator constantly makes the mistakes of
the middle-class moralist when he attempts to aid working people. The
latter has constantly and traditionally urged upon the workingman the
specialized virtues of thrift, industry, and sobriety—all virtues
pertaining to the individual. When each man had his own shop, it was
perhaps wise to lay almost exclusive stress
upon the industrial virtues of diligence and thrift; but as industry has
become more highly organized, life becomes incredibly complex and
interdependent. If a workingman is to have a conception of his value at
all, he must see industry in its unity and entirety; he must have a
conception that will include not only himself and his immediate family
and community, but the industrial organization as a whole. It is
doubtless true that dexterity of hand becomes less and less imperative
as the invention of machinery and subdivision of labor proceeds; but it
becomes all the more necessary, if the workman is to save his life at
all, that he should get a sense of his individual relation to the
system. Feeding a machine with a material of which he has no knowledge,
producing a product, totally unrelated to the rest of his life, without
in the least knowing what becomes of it, or its connection with the
community, is, of course, unquestionably deadening to his intellectual
 and moral life. To make the moral connection it
would be necessary to give him a social consciousness of the value of
his work, and at least a sense of participation and a certain joy in its
ultimate use; to make the intellectual connection it would be essential
to create in him some historic conception of the development of industry
and the relation of his individual work to it.</p>

<p>Workingmen themselves have made attempts in both directions, which it
would be well for moralists and educators to study. It is a striking
fact that when workingmen formulate their own moral code, and try to
inspire and encourage each other, it is always a large and general
doctrine which they preach. They were the first class of men to organize
an international association, and the constant talk at a modern labor
meeting is of solidarity and of the identity of the interests of
workingmen the world over. It is difficult to secure a successful
organization of men into the simplest trades organization without an appeal to the most abstract principles
of justice and brotherhood. As they have formulated their own morals by
laying the greatest stress upon the largest morality, so if they could
found their own schools, it is doubtful whether they would be of the
mechanic institute type. Courses of study arranged by a group of
workingmen are most naïve in their breadth and generality. They will
select the history of the world in preference to that of any period or
nation. The "wonders of science" or "the story of evolution" will
attract workingmen to a lecture when zoölogy or chemistry will drive
them away. The "outlines of literature" or "the best in literature" will
draw an audience when a lecturer in English poetry will be solitary.
This results partly from a wholesome desire to have general knowledge
before special knowledge, and is partly a rebound from the
specialization of labor to which the workingman is subjected. When he is
free from work and can direct his own mind, he
tends to roam, to dwell upon large themes. Much the same tendency is
found in programmes of study arranged by Woman's Clubs in country
places. The untrained mind, wearied with meaningless detail, when it
gets an opportunity to make its demand heard, asks for general
philosophy and background.</p>

<p>In a certain sense commercialism itself, at least in its larger aspect,
tends to educate the workingman better than organized education does.
Its interests are certainly world-wide and democratic, while it is
absolutely undiscriminating as to country and creed, coming into contact
with all climes and races. If this aspect of commercialism were
utilized, it would in a measure counterbalance the tendency which
results from the subdivision of labor.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy attempt to utilize this democracy of commerce in
relation to manufacturing is found at Dayton, Ohio, in the yearly
gatherings held in a large factory there. Once a year the entire force
 is gathered together to hear the returns of the
business, not so much in respect to the profits, as in regard to its
extension. At these meetings, the travelling salesmen from various parts
of the world—from Constantinople, from Berlin, from Rome, from Hong
Kong—report upon the sales they have made, and the methods of
advertisement and promotion adapted to the various countries.</p>

<p>Stereopticon lectures are given upon each new country as soon as it has
been successfully invaded by the product of the factory. The foremen in
the various departments of the factory give accounts of the increased
efficiency and the larger output over former years. Any man who has made
an invention in connection with the machinery of the factory, at this
time publicly receives a prize, and suggestions are approved that tend
to increase the comfort and social facilities of the employees. At least
for the moment there is a complete esprit de corps, and the youngest and
least skilled employee sees himself in connection with the interests of the firm, and the spread of an invention. It is
a crude example of what might be done in the way of giving a large
framework of meaning to factory labor, and of putting it into a sentient
background, at least on the commercial side.</p>

<p>It is easy to indict the educator, to say that he has gotten entangled
in his own material, and has fallen a victim to his own methods; but
granting this, what has the artist done about it—he who is supposed to
have a more intimate insight into the needs of his contemporaries, and
to minister to them as none other can?</p>

<p>It is quite true that a few writers are insisting that the growing
desire for labor, on the part of many people of leisure, has its
counterpart in the increasing desire for general knowledge on the part
of many laborers. They point to the fact that the same duality of
conscience which seems to stifle the noblest effort in the individual
because his intellectual conception and his achievement are so difficult
to bring together, is found on a large scale in
society itself, when we have the separation of the people who think from
those who work. And yet, since Ruskin ceased, no one has really
formulated this in a convincing form. And even Ruskin's famous dictum,
that labor without art brutalizes, has always been interpreted as if art
could only be a sense of beauty or joy in one's own work, and not a
sense of companionship with all other workers. The situation demands the
consciousness of participation and well-being which comes to the
individual when he is able to see himself "in connection and cooperation
with the whole"; it needs the solace of collective art inherent in
collective labor.</p>

<p>As the poet bathes the outer world for us in the hues of human feeling,
so the workman needs some one to bathe his surroundings with a human
significance—some one who shall teach him to find that which will give
a potency to his life. His education, however simple, should tend to
make him widely at home in the world, and to
give him a sense of simplicity and peace in the midst of the triviality
and noise to which he is constantly subjected. He, like other men, can
learn to be content to see but a part, although it must be a part of
something.</p>

<p>It is because of a lack of democracy that we do not really incorporate
him in the hopes and advantages of society, and give him the place which
is his by simple right. We have learned to say that the good must be
extended to all of society before it can be held secure by any one
person or any one class; but we have not yet learned to add to that
statement, that unless all men and all classes contribute to a good, we
cannot even be sure that it is worth having. In spite of many attempts
we do not really act upon either statement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h4>POLITICAL REFORM</h4>

<p>Throughout this volume we have assumed that much of our ethical
maladjustment in social affairs arises from the fact that we are acting
upon a code of ethics adapted to individual relationships, but not to
the larger social relationships to which it is bunglingly applied. In
addition, however, to the consequent strain and difficulty, there is
often an honest lack of perception as to what the situation demands.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this more obvious than in our political life as it manifests
itself in certain quarters of every great city. It is most difficult to
hold to our political democracy and to make it in any sense a social
expression and not a mere governmental contrivance, unless we take pains
to keep on common ground in our human
experiences. Otherwise there is in various parts of the community an
inevitable difference of ethical standards which becomes responsible for
much misunderstanding.</p>

<p>It is difficult both to interpret sympathetically the motives and ideals
of those who have acquired rules of conduct in experience widely
different from our own, and also to take enough care in guarding the
gains already made, and in valuing highly enough the imperfect good so
painfully acquired and, at the best, so mixed with evil. This wide
difference in daily experience exhibits itself in two distinct attitudes
toward politics. The well-to-do men of the community think of politics
as something off by itself; they may conscientiously recognize political
duty as part of good citizenship, but political effort is not the
expression of their moral or social life. As a result of this
detachment, "reform movements," started by business men and the better
element, are almost wholly occupied in the correction of political
machinery and with a concern for the better
method of administration, rather than with the ultimate purpose of
securing the welfare of the people. They fix their attention so
exclusively on methods that they fail to consider the final aims of city
government. This accounts for the growing tendency to put more and more
responsibility upon executive officers and appointed commissions at the
expense of curtailing the power of the direct representatives of the
voters. Reform movements tend to become negative and to lose their
educational value for the mass of the people. The reformers take the
rôle of the opposition. They give themselves largely to criticisms of
the present state of affairs, to writing and talking of what the future
must be and of certain results which should be obtained. In trying to
better matters, however, they have in mind only political achievements
which they detach in a curious way from the rest of life, and they speak
and write of the purification of politics as of a thing set apart from
daily life.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the real leaders of the people
are part of the entire life of the community which they control, and so
far as they are representative at all, are giving a social expression to
democracy. They are often politically corrupt, but in spite of this they
are proceeding upon a sounder theory. Although they would be totally
unable to give it abstract expression, they are really acting upon a
formulation made by a shrewd English observer; namely, that, "after the
enfranchisement of the masses, social ideals enter into political
programmes, and they enter not as something which at best can be
indirectly promoted by government, but as something which it is the
chief business of government to advance directly."</p>

<p>Men living near to the masses of voters, and knowing them intimately,
recognize this and act upon it; they minister directly to life and to
social needs. They realize that the people as a whole are clamoring for
social results, and they hold their power because they respond to that
demand. They are corrupt and often do their
work badly; but they at least avoid the mistake of a certain type of
business men who are frightened by democracy, and have lost their faith
in the people. The two standards are similar to those seen at a popular
exhibition of pictures where the cultivated people care most for the
technique of a given painting, the moving mass for a subject that shall
be domestic and human.</p>

<p>This difference may be illustrated by the writer's experience in a
certain ward of Chicago, during three campaigns, when efforts were made
to dislodge an alderman who had represented the ward for many years. In
this ward there are gathered together fifty thousand people,
representing a score of nationalities; the newly emigrated Latin,
Teuton, Celt, Greek, and Slav who live there have little in common save
the basic experiences which come to men in all countries and under all
conditions. In order to make fifty thousand people, so heterogeneous in
nationality, religion, and customs, agree upon any demand, it must be founded upon universal
experiences which are perforce individual and not social.</p>

<p>An instinctive recognition of this on the part of the alderman makes it
possible to understand the individualistic basis of his political
success, but it remains extremely difficult to ascertain the reasons for
the extreme leniency of judgment concerning the political corruption of
which he is constantly guilty.</p>

<p>This leniency is only to be explained on the ground that his
constituents greatly admire individual virtues, and that they are at the
same time unable to perceive social outrages which the alderman may be
committing. They thus free the alderman from blame because his
corruption is social, and they honestly admire him as a great man and
hero, because his individual acts are on the whole kindly and generous.</p>

<p>In certain stages of moral evolution, a man is incapable of action
unless the results will benefit himself or some one of his
acquaintances, and it is a long step in moral
progress to set the good of the many before the interest of the few, and
to be concerned for the welfare of a community without hope of an
individual return. How far the selfish politician befools his
constituents into believing that their interests are identical with his
own; how far he presumes upon their inability to distinguish between the
individual and social virtues, an inability which he himself shares with
them; and how far he dazzles them by the sense of his greatness, and a
conviction that they participate therein, it is difficult to determine.</p>

<p>Morality certainly develops far earlier in the form of moral fact than
in the form of moral ideas, and it is obvious that ideas only operate
upon the popular mind through will and character, and must be dramatized
before they reach the mass of men, even as the biography of the saints
have been after all "the main guide to the stumbling feet of thousands
of Christians to whom the Credo has been but mysterious words."</p>

<p>Ethics as well as political opinions may be
discussed and disseminated among the sophisticated by lectures and
printed pages, but to the common people they can only come through
example—through a personality which seizes the popular imagination. The
advantage of an unsophisticated neighborhood is, that the inhabitants do
not keep their ideas as treasures—they are untouched by the notion of
accumulating them, as they might knowledge or money, and they frankly
act upon those they have. The personal example promptly rouses to
emulation. In a neighborhood where political standards are plastic and
undeveloped, and where there has been little previous experience in
self-government, the office-holder himself sets the standard, and the
ideas that cluster around him exercise a specific and permanent
influence upon the political morality of his constituents.</p>

<p>Nothing is more certain than that the quality which a heterogeneous
population, living in one of the less sophisticated wards, most admires is the quality of simple goodness;
that the man who attracts them is the one whom they believe to be a good
man. We all know that children long "to be good" with an intensity which
they give to no other ambition. We can all remember that the earliest
strivings of our childhood were in this direction, and that we venerated
grown people because they had attained perfection.</p>

<p>Primitive people, such as the South Italian peasants, are still in this
stage. They want to be good, and deep down in their hearts they admire
nothing so much as the good man. Abstract virtues are too difficult for
their untrained minds to apprehend, and many of them are still simple
enough to believe that power and wealth come only to good people.</p>

<p>The successful candidate, then, must be a good man according to the
morality of his constituents. He must not attempt to hold up too high a
standard, nor must he attempt to reform or change their standards. His
 safety lies in doing on a large scale the good
deeds which his constituents are able to do only on a small scale. If he
believes what they believe and does what they are all cherishing a
secret ambition to do, he will dazzle them by his success and win their
confidence. There is a certain wisdom in this course. There is a common
sense in the mass of men which cannot be neglected with impunity, just
as there is sure to be an eccentricity in the differing and reforming
individual which it is perhaps well to challenge.</p>

<p>The constant kindness of the poor to each other was pointed out in a
previous chapter, and that they unfailingly respond to the need and
distresses of their poorer neighbors even when in danger of bankruptcy
themselves. The kindness which a poor man shows his distressed neighbor
is doubtless heightened by the consciousness that he himself may be in
distress next week; he therefore stands by his friend when he gets too
drunk to take care of himself, when he loses his wife or child, when he is evicted for non-payment of rent,
when he is arrested for a petty crime. It seems to such a man entirely
fitting that his alderman should do the same thing on a larger
scale—that he should help a constituent out of trouble, merely because
he is in trouble, irrespective of the justice involved.</p>

<p>The alderman therefore bails out his constituents when they are
arrested, or says a good word to the police justice when they appear
before him for trial, uses his pull with the magistrate when they are
likely to be fined for a civil misdemeanor, or sees what he can do to
"fix up matters" with the state's attorney when the charge is really a
serious one, and in doing this he follows the ethics held and practised
by his constituents. All this conveys the impression to the
simple-minded that law is not enforced, if the lawbreaker have a
powerful friend. One may instance the alderman's action in standing by
an Italian padrone of the ward when he was indicted for violating the
civil service regulations. The commissioners had sent out notices to certain Italian day-laborers
who were upon the eligible list that they were to report for work at a
given day and hour. One of the padrones intercepted these notifications
and sold them to the men for five dollars apiece, making also the usual
bargain for a share of their wages. The padrone's entire arrangement
followed the custom which had prevailed for years before the
establishment of civil service laws. Ten of the laborers swore out
warrants against the padrone, who was convicted and fined seventy-five
dollars. This sum was promptly paid by the alderman, and the padrone,
assured that he would be protected from any further trouble, returned
uninjured to the colony. The simple Italians were much bewildered by
this show of a power stronger than that of the civil service, which they
had trusted as they did the one in Italy. The first violation of its
authority was made, and various sinister acts have followed, until no
Italian who is digging a sewer or sweeping a street for the city feels
quite secure in holding his job unless he is
backed by the friendship of the alderman. According to the civil service
law, a laborer has no right to a trial; many are discharged by the
foreman, and find that they can be reinstated only upon the aldermanic
recommendation. He thus practically holds his old power over the
laborers working for the city. The popular mind is convinced that an
honest administration of civil service is impossible, and that it is but
one more instrument in the hands of the powerful.</p>

<p>It will be difficult to establish genuine civil service among these men,
who learn only by experience, since their experiences have been of such
a nature that their unanimous vote would certainly be that "civil
service" is "no good."</p>

<p>As many of his constituents in this case are impressed with the fact
that the aldermanic power is superior to that of government, so
instances of actual lawbreaking might easily be cited. A young man may
enter a saloon long after midnight, the legal
closing hour, and seat himself at a gambling table, perfectly secure
from interruption or arrest, because the place belongs to an alderman;
but in order to secure this immunity the policeman on the beat must
pretend not to see into the windows each time that he passes, and he
knows, and the young man knows that he knows, that nothing would
embarrass "Headquarters" more than to have an arrest made on those
premises. A certain contempt for the whole machinery of law and order is
thus easily fostered.</p>

<p>Because of simple friendliness the alderman is expected to pay rent for
the hard-pressed tenant when no rent is forthcoming, to find "jobs" when
work is hard to get, to procure and divide among his constituents all
the places which he can seize from the city hall. The alderman of the
ward we are considering at one time could make the proud boast that he
had twenty-six hundred people in his ward upon the public pay-roll.
This, of course, included day laborers, but
each one felt under distinct obligations to him for getting a position.
When we reflect that this is one-third of the entire vote of the ward,
we realize that it is very important to vote for the right man, since
there is, at the least, one chance out of three for securing work.</p>

<p>If we recollect further that the franchise-seeking companies pay
respectful heed to the applicants backed by the alderman, the question
of voting for the successful man becomes as much an industrial one as a
political one. An Italian laborer wants a "job" more than anything else,
and quite simply votes for the man who promises him one. It is not so
different from his relation to the padrone, and, indeed, the two
strengthen each other.</p>

<p>The alderman may himself be quite sincere in his acts of kindness, for
an office seeker may begin with the simple desire to alleviate
suffering, and this may gradually change into the desire to put his
constituents under obligations to him; but the
action of such an individual becomes a demoralizing element in the
community when kindly impulse is made a cloak for the satisfaction of
personal ambition, and when the plastic morals of his constituents
gradually conform to his own undeveloped standards.</p>

<p>The alderman gives presents at weddings and christenings. He seizes
these days of family festivities for making friends. It is easiest to
reach them in the holiday mood of expansive good-will, but on their side
it seems natural and kindly that he should do it. The alderman procures
passes from the railroads when his constituents wish to visit friends or
attend the funerals of distant relatives; he buys tickets galore for
benefit entertainments given for a widow or a consumptive in peculiar
distress; he contributes to prizes which are awarded to the handsomest
lady or the most popular man. At a church bazaar, for instance, the
alderman finds the stage all set for his dramatic performance. When
others are spending pennies, he is spending
dollars. When anxious relatives are canvassing to secure votes for the
two most beautiful children who are being voted upon, he recklessly buys
votes from both sides, and laughingly declines to say which one he likes
best, buying off the young lady who is persistently determined to find
out, with five dollars for the flower bazaar, the posies, of course, to
be sent to the sick of the parish. The moral atmosphere of a bazaar
suits him exactly. He murmurs many times, "Never mind, the money all
goes to the poor; it is all straight enough if the church gets it, the
poor won't ask too many questions." The oftener he can put such
sentiments into the minds of his constituents, the better he is pleased.
Nothing so rapidly prepares them to take his view of money getting and
money spending. We see again the process disregarded, because the end
itself is considered so praiseworthy.</p>

<p>There is something archaic in a community of
simple people in their attitude toward death and burial. There is
nothing so easy to collect money for as a funeral, and one involuntarily
remembers that the early religious tithes were paid to ward off death
and ghosts. At times one encounters almost the Greek feeling in regard
to burial. If the alderman seizes upon times of festivities for
expressions of his good-will, much more does he seize upon periods of
sorrow. At a funeral he has the double advantage of ministering to a
genuine craving for comfort and solace, and at the same time of
assisting a bereaved constituent to express that curious feeling of
remorse, which is ever an accompaniment of quick sorrow, that desire to
"make up" for past delinquencies, to show the world how much he loved
the person who has just died, which is as natural as it is universal.</p>

<p>In addition to this, there is, among the poor, who have few social
occasions, a great desire for a well-arranged funeral, the grade of which almost determines their social
standing in the neighborhood. The alderman saves the very poorest of his
constituents from that awful horror of burial by the county; he provides
carriages for the poor, who otherwise could not have them. It may be too
much to say that all the relatives and friends who ride in the carriages
provided by the alderman's bounty vote for him, but they are certainly
influenced by his kindness, and talk of his virtues during the long
hours of the ride back and forth from the suburban cemetery. A man who
would ask at such a time where all the money thus spent comes from would
be considered sinister. The tendency to speak lightly of the faults of
the dead and to judge them gently is transferred to the living, and many
a man at such a time has formulated a lenient judgment of political
corruption, and has heard kindly speeches which he has remembered on
election day. "Ah, well, he has a big Irish heart. He is good to the widow and the fatherless." "He knows the poor
better than the big guns who are always talking about civil service and
reform."</p>

<p>Indeed, what headway can the notion of civic purity, of honesty of
administration make against this big manifestation of human
friendliness, this stalking survival of village kindness? The notions of
the civic reformer are negative and impotent before it. Such an alderman
will keep a standing account with an undertaker, and telephone every
week, and sometimes more than once, the kind of funeral he wishes
provided for a bereaved constituent, until the sum may roll up into
"hundreds a year." He understands what the people want, and ministers
just as truly to a great human need as the musician or the artist. An
attempt to substitute what we might call a later standard was made at
one time when a delicate little child was deserted in the Hull-House
nursery. An investigation showed that it had been born ten days
previously in the Cook County hospital, but no
trace could be found of the unfortunate mother. The little child lived
for several weeks, and then, in spite of every care, died. It was
decided to have it buried by the county authorities, and the wagon was
to arrive at eleven o'clock; about nine o'clock in the morning the rumor
of this awful deed reached the neighbors. A half dozen of them came, in
a very excited state of mind, to protest. They took up a collection out
of their poverty with which to defray a funeral. The residents of
Hull-House were then comparatively new in the neighborhood and did not
realize that they were really shocking a genuine moral sentiment of the
community. In their crudeness they instanced the care and tenderness
which had been expended upon the little creature while it was alive;
that it had had every attention from a skilled physician and a trained
nurse, and even intimated that the excited members of the group had not
taken part in this, and that it now lay with the nursery to decide that
it should be buried as it had been born, at the
county's expense. It is doubtful if Hull-House has ever done anything
which injured it so deeply in the minds of some of its neighbors. It was
only forgiven by the most indulgent on the ground that the residents
were spinsters, and could not know a mother's heart. No one born and
reared in the community could possibly have made a mistake like that. No
one who had studied the ethical standards with any care could have
bungled so completely.</p>

<p>We are constantly underestimating the amount of sentiment among simple
people. The songs which are most popular among them are those of a
reminiscent old age, in which the ripened soul calmly recounts and
regrets the sins of his youth, songs in which the wayward daughter is
forgiven by her loving parents, in which the lovers are magnanimous and
faithful through all vicissitudes. The tendency is to condone and
forgive, and not hold too rigidly to a standard. In the theatres it is
the magnanimous man, the kindly reckless
villain who is always applauded. So shrewd an observer as Samuel Johnson
once remarked that it was surprising to find how much more kindness than
justice society contained.</p>

<p>On the same basis the alderman manages several saloons, one down town
within easy access of the city hall, where he can catch the more
important of his friends. Here again he has seized upon an old tradition
and primitive custom, the good fellowship which has long been best
expressed when men drink together. The saloons offer a common meeting
ground, with stimulus enough to free the wits and tongues of the men who
meet there.</p>

<p>He distributes each Christmas many tons of turkeys not only to voters,
but to families who are represented by no vote. By a judicious
management some families get three or four turkeys apiece; but what of
that, the alderman has none of the nagging rules of the charitable
societies, nor does he declare that because a man wants two turkeys for Christmas, he is a scoundrel who shall never be
allowed to eat turkey again. As he does not distribute his Christmas
favors from any hardly acquired philanthropic motive, there is no
disposition to apply the carefully evolved rules of the charitable
societies to his beneficiaries. Of course, there are those who suspect
that the benevolence rests upon self-seeking motives, and feel
themselves quite freed from any sense of gratitude; others go further
and glory in the fact that they can thus "soak the alderman." An example
of this is the young man who fills his pockets with a handful of cigars,
giving a sly wink at the others. But this freedom from any sense of
obligation is often the first step downward to the position where he is
willing to sell his vote to both parties, and then scratch his ticket as
he pleases. The writer recalls a conversation with a man in which he
complained quite openly, and with no sense of shame, that his vote had
"sold for only two dollars this year," and that he was "awfully disappointed." The writer happened to know that
his income during the nine months previous had been but twenty-eight
dollars, and that he was in debt thirty-two dollars, and she could well
imagine the eagerness with which he had counted upon this source of
revenue. After some years the selling of votes becomes a commonplace,
and but little attempt is made upon the part of the buyer or seller to
conceal the fact, if the transaction runs smoothly.</p>

<p>A certain lodging-house keeper at one time sold the votes of his entire
house to a political party and was "well paid for it too"; but being of
a grasping turn, he also sold the house for the same election to the
rival party. Such an outrage could not be borne. The man was treated to
a modern version of tar and feathers, and as a result of being held
under a street hydrant in November, contracted pneumonia which resulted
in his death. No official investigation took place, since the doctor's
certificate of pneumonia was sufficient for legal burial, and public sentiment sustained the action. In various
conversations which the writer had concerning the entire transaction,
she discovered great indignation concerning his duplicity and treachery,
but none whatever for his original offence of selling out the votes of
his house.</p>

<p>A club will be started for the express purpose of gaining a reputation
for political power which may later be sold out. The president and
executive committee of such a club, who will naturally receive the
funds, promise to divide with "the boys" who swell the size of the
membership. A reform movement is at first filled with recruits who are
active and loud in their assertions of the number of votes they can
"deliver." The reformers are delighted with this display of zeal, and
only gradually find out that many of the recruits are there for the
express purpose of being bought by the other side; that they are most
active in order to seem valuable, and thus raise the price of their
allegiance when they are ready to sell. Reformers seeing them drop away one by one, talk of
desertion from the ranks of reform, and of the power of money over
well-meaning men, who are too weak to withstand temptation; but in
reality the men are not deserters because they have never actually been
enrolled in the ranks. The money they take is neither a bribe nor the
price of their loyalty, it is simply the consummation of a
long-cherished plan and a well-earned reward. They came into the new
movement for the purpose of being bought out of it, and have
successfully accomplished that purpose.</p>

<p>Hull-House assisted in carrying on two unsuccessful campaigns against
the same alderman. In the two years following the end of the first one,
nearly every man who had been prominent in it had received an office
from the reëlected alderman. A printer had been appointed to a clerkship
in the city hall; a driver received a large salary for services in the
police barns; the candidate himself, a bricklayer, held a position in
the city construction department. At the beginning of the next campaign, the greatest difficulty was
experienced in finding a candidate, and each one proposed, demanded time
to consider the proposition. During this period he invariably became the
recipient of the alderman's bounty. The first one, who was foreman of a
large factory, was reported to have been bought off by the promise that
the city institutions would use the product of his firm. The second one,
a keeper of a grocery and family saloon, with large popularity, was
promised the aldermanic nomination on the regular ticket at the
expiration of the term of office held by the alderman's colleague, and
it may be well to state in passing that he was thus nominated and
successfully elected. The third proposed candidate received a place for
his son in the office of the city attorney.</p>

<p>Not only are offices in his gift, but all smaller favors as well. Any
requests to the council, or special licenses, must be presented by the
alderman of the ward in which the person desiring the favor resides. There is thus constant opportunity for the
alderman to put his constituents under obligations to him, to make it
difficult for a constituent to withstand him, or for one with large
interests to enter into political action at all. From the Italian pedler
who wants a license to peddle fruit in the street, to the large
manufacturing company who desires to tunnel an alley for the sake of
conveying pipes from one building to another, everybody is under
obligations to his alderman, and is constantly made to feel it. In
short, these very regulations for presenting requests to the council
have been made, by the aldermen themselves, for the express purpose of
increasing the dependence of their constituents, and thereby augmenting
aldermanic power and prestige.</p>

<p>The alderman has also a very singular hold upon the property owners of
his ward. The paving, both of the streets and sidewalks throughout his
district, is disgraceful; and in the election speeches the reform side
holds him responsible for this condition, and
promises better paving under another régime. But the paving could not be
made better without a special assessment upon the property owners of the
vicinity, and paying more taxes is exactly what his constituents do not
want to do. In reality, "getting them off," or at the worst postponing
the time of the improvement, is one of the genuine favors which he
performs. A movement to have the paving done from a general fund would
doubtless be opposed by the property owners in other parts of the city
who have already paid for the asphalt bordering their own possessions,
but they have no conception of the struggle and possible bankruptcy
which repaving may mean to the small property owner, nor how his chief
concern may be to elect an alderman who cares more for the feelings and
pocket-books of his constituents than he does for the repute and
cleanliness of his city.</p>

<p>The alderman exhibited great wisdom in procuring from certain of his
down-town friends the sum of three thousand dollars with which to uniform and equip a boys' temperance
brigade which had been formed in one of the ward churches a few months
before his campaign. Is it strange that the good leader, whose heart was
filled with innocent pride as he looked upon these promising young
scions of virtue, should decline to enter into a reform campaign? Of
what use to suggest that uniforms and bayonets for the purpose of
promoting temperance, bought with money contributed by a man who was
proprietor of a saloon and a gambling house, might perhaps confuse the
ethics of the young soldiers? Why take the pains to urge that it was
vain to lecture and march abstract virtues into them, so long as the
"champion boodler" of the town was the man whom the boys recognized as a
loyal and kindhearted friend, the public-spirited citizen, whom their
fathers enthusiastically voted for, and their mothers called "the friend
of the poor." As long as the actual and tangible success is thus
embodied, marching whether in kindergartens or brigades, talking whether in clubs or classes, does little to
change the code of ethics.</p>

<p>The question of where does the money come from which is spent so
successfully, does of course occur to many minds. The more primitive
people accept the truthful statement of its sources without any shock to
their moral sense. To their simple minds he gets it "from the rich" and,
so long as he again gives it out to the poor as a true Robin Hood, with
open hand, they have no objections to offer. Their ethics are quite
honestly those of the merry-making foresters. The next less primitive
people of the vicinage are quite willing to admit that he leads the
"gang" in the city council, and sells out the city franchises; that he
makes deals with the franchise-seeking companies; that he guarantees to
steer dubious measures through the council, for which he demands liberal
pay; that he is, in short, a successful "boodler." When, however, there
is intellect enough to get this point of view, there is also enough to
make the contention that this is universally
done, that all the aldermen do it more or less successfully, but that
the alderman of this particular ward is unique in being so generous;
that such a state of affairs is to be deplored, of course; but that that
is the way business is run, and we are fortunate when a kind-hearted man
who is close to the people gets a large share of the spoils; that he
serves franchised companies who employ men in the building and
construction of their enterprises, and that they are bound in return to
give work to his constituents. It is again the justification of stealing
from the rich to give to the poor. Even when they are intelligent enough
to complete the circle, and to see that the money comes, not from the
pockets of the companies' agents, but from the street-car fares of
people like themselves, it almost seems as if they would rather pay two
cents more each time they ride than to give up the consciousness that
they have a big, warm-hearted friend at court who will stand by them in
an emergency. The sense of just dealing comes
apparently much later than the desire for protection and indulgence. On
the whole, the gifts and favors are taken quite simply as an evidence of
genuine loving-kindness. The alderman is really elected because he is a
good friend and neighbor. He is corrupt, of course, but he is not
elected because he is corrupt, but rather in spite of it. His standard
suits his constituents. He exemplifies and exaggerates the popular type
of a good man. He has attained what his constituents secretly long for.</p>

<p>At one end of the ward there is a street of good houses, familiarly
called "Con Row." The term is perhaps quite unjustly used, but it is
nevertheless universally applied, because many of these houses are
occupied by professional office holders. This row is supposed to form a
happy hunting-ground of the successful politician, where he can live in
prosperity, and still maintain his vote and influence in the ward. It
would be difficult to justly estimate the influence which this group of successful, prominent men,
including the alderman who lives there, have had upon the ideals of the
youth in the vicinity. The path which leads to riches and success, to
civic prominence and honor, is the path of political corruption. We
might compare this to the path laid out by Benjamin Franklin, who also
secured all of these things, but told young men that they could be
obtained only by strenuous effort and frugal living, by the cultivation
of the mind, and the holding fast to righteousness; or, again, we might
compare it to the ideals which were held up to the American youth fifty
years ago, lower, to be sure, than the revolutionary ideal, but still
fine and aspiring toward honorable dealing and careful living. They were
told that the career of the self-made man was open to every American
boy, if he worked hard and saved his money, improved his mind, and
followed a steady ambition. The writer remembers that when she was ten
years old, the village schoolmaster told his
little flock, without any mitigating clauses, that Jay Gould had laid
the foundation of his colossal fortune by always saving bits of string,
and that, as a result, every child in the village assiduously collected
party-colored balls of twine. A bright Chicago boy might well draw the
inference that the path of the corrupt politician not only leads to
civic honors, but to the glories of benevolence and philanthropy. This
lowering of standards, this setting of an ideal, is perhaps the worst of
the situation, for, as we said in the first chapter, we determine ideals
by our daily actions and decisions not only for ourselves, but largely
for each other.</p>

<p>We are all involved in this political corruption, and as members of the
community stand indicted. This is the penalty of a democracy,—that we
are bound to move forward or retrograde together. None of us can stand
aside; our feet are mired in the same soil, and our lungs breathe the
same air.</p>

<p>That the alderman has much to do with setting the
standard of life and desirable prosperity may be illustrated by the
following incident: During one of the campaigns a clever cartoonist drew
a poster representing the successful alderman in portraiture drinking
champagne at a table loaded with pretentious dishes and surrounded by
other revellers. In contradistinction was his opponent, a bricklayer,
who sat upon a half-finished wall, eating a meagre dinner from a
workingman's dinner-pail, and the passer-by was asked which type of
representative he preferred, the presumption being that at least in a
workingman's district the bricklayer would come out ahead. To the
chagrin of the reformers, however, it was gradually discovered that, in
the popular mind, a man who laid bricks and wore overalls was not nearly
so desirable for an alderman as the man who drank champagne and wore a
diamond in his shirt front. The district wished its representative "to
stand up with the best of them," and certainly
some of the constituents would have been ashamed to have been
represented by a bricklayer. It is part of that general desire to appear
well, the optimistic and thoroughly American belief, that even if a man
is working with his hands to-day, he and his children will quite likely
be in a better position in the swift coming to-morrow, and there is no
need of being too closely associated with common working people. There
is an honest absence of class consciousness, and a naïve belief that the
kind of occupation quite largely determines social position. This is
doubtless exaggerated in a neighborhood of foreign people by the fact
that as each nationality becomes more adapted to American conditions,
the scale of its occupation rises. Fifty years ago in America "a
Dutchman" was used as a term of reproach, meaning a man whose language
was not understood, and who performed menial tasks, digging sewers and
building railroad embankments. Later the Irish did the same work in the community, but as quickly as
possible handed it on to the Italians, to whom the name "dago" is said
to cling as a result of the digging which the Irishman resigned to him.
The Italian himself is at last waking up to this fact. In a political
speech recently made by an Italian padrone, he bitterly reproached the
alderman for giving the-four-dollars-a-day "jobs" of sitting in an
office to Irishmen and the-dollar-and-a-half-a-day "jobs" of sweeping
the streets to the Italians. This general struggle to rise in life, to
be at least politically represented by one of the best, as to occupation
and social status, has also its negative side. We must remember that the
imitative impulse plays an important part in life, and that the loss of
social estimation, keenly felt by all of us, is perhaps most dreaded by
the humblest, among whom freedom of individual conduct, the power to
give only just weight to the opinion of neighbors, is but feebly
developed. A form of constraint, gentle, but powerful, is afforded by the simple desire to do what others
do, in order to share with them the approval of the community. Of
course, the larger the number of people among whom an habitual mode of
conduct obtains, the greater the constraint it puts upon the individual
will. Thus it is that the political corruption of the city presses most
heavily where it can be least resisted, and is most likely to be
imitated.</p>

<p>According to the same law, the positive evils of corrupt government are
bound to fall heaviest upon the poorest and least capable. When the
water of Chicago is foul, the prosperous buy water bottled at distant
springs; the poor have no alternative but the typhoid fever which comes
from using the city's supply. When the garbage contracts are not
enforced, the well-to-do pay for private service; the poor suffer the
discomfort and illness which are inevitable from a foul atmosphere. The
prosperous business man has a certain choice as to whether he will treat
with the "boss" politician or preserve his
independence on a smaller income; but to an Italian day laborer it is a
choice between obeying the commands of a political "boss" or practical
starvation. Again, a more intelligent man may philosophize a little upon
the present state of corruption, and reflect that it is but a phase of
our commercialism, from which we are bound to emerge; at any rate, he
may give himself the solace of literature and ideals in other
directions, but the more ignorant man who lives only in the narrow
present has no such resource; slowly the conviction enters his mind that
politics is a matter of favors and positions, that self-government means
pleasing the "boss" and standing in with the "gang." This slowly
acquired knowledge he hands on to his family. During the month of
February his boy may come home from school with rather incoherent tales
about Washington and Lincoln, and the father may for the moment be fired
to tell of Garibaldi, but such talk is only periodic, and the long year round the fortunes of the entire
family, down to the opportunity to earn food and shelter, depend upon
the "boss."</p>

<p>In a certain measure also, the opportunities for pleasure and recreation
depend upon him. To use a former illustration, if a man happens to have
a taste for gambling, if the slot machine affords him diversion, he goes
to those houses which are protected by political influence. If he and
his friends like to drop into a saloon after midnight, or even want to
hear a little music while they drink together early in the evening, he
is breaking the law when he indulges in either of them, and can only be
exempt from arrest or fine because the great political machine is
friendly to him and expects his allegiance in return.</p>

<p>During the campaign, when it was found hard to secure enough local
speakers of the moral tone which was desired, orators were imported from
other parts of the town, from the so-called "better element." Suddenly it was rumored on all sides that, while
the money and speakers for the reform candidate were coming from the
swells, the money which was backing the corrupt alderman also came from
a swell source; that the president of a street-car combination, for whom
he performed constant offices in the city council, was ready to back him
to the extent of fifty thousand dollars; that this president, too, was a
good man, and sat in high places; that he had recently given a large sum
of money to an educational institution and was therefore as
philanthropic, not to say good and upright, as any man in town; that the
corrupt alderman had the sanction of the highest authorities, and that
the lecturers who were talking against corruption, and the selling and
buying of franchises, were only the cranks, and not the solid business
men who had developed and built up Chicago.</p>

<p>All parts of the community are bound together in ethical development. If
the so-called more enlightened members accept
corporate gifts from the man who buys up the council, and the so-called
less enlightened members accept individual gifts from the man who sells
out the council, we surely must take our punishment together. There is
the difference, of course, that in the first case we act collectively,
and in the second case individually; but is the punishment which follows
the first any lighter or less far-reaching in its consequences than the
more obvious one which follows the second?</p>

<p>Have our morals been so captured by commercialism, to use Mr. Chapman's
generalization, that we do not see a moral dereliction when business or
educational interests are served thereby, although we are still shocked
when the saloon interest is thus served?</p>

<p>The street-car company which declares that it is impossible to do
business without managing the city council, is on exactly the same moral
level with the man who cannot retain political power unless he has a
saloon, a large acquaintance with the semi-criminal class, and questionable money with which to
debauch his constituents. Both sets of men assume that the only appeal
possible is along the line of self-interest. They frankly acknowledge
money getting as their own motive power, and they believe in the
cupidity of all the men whom they encounter. No attempt in either case
is made to put forward the claims of the public, or to find a moral
basis for action. As the corrupt politician assumes that public morality
is impossible, so many business men become convinced that to pay tribute
to the corrupt aldermen is on the whole cheaper than to have taxes too
high; that it is better to pay exorbitant rates for franchises, than to
be made unwilling partners in transportation experiments. Such men come
to regard political reformers as a sort of monomaniac, who are not
reasonable enough to see the necessity of the present arrangement which
has slowly been evolved and developed, and upon which business is safely
conducted. A reformer who really knew the people and their great human needs, who believed that it
was the business of government to serve them, and who further recognized
the educative power of a sense of responsibility, would possess a clew
by which he might analyze the situation. He would find out what needs,
which the alderman supplies, are legitimate ones which the city itself
could undertake, in counter-distinction to those which pander to the
lower instincts of the constituency. A mother who eats her Christmas
turkey in a reverent spirit of thankfulness to the alderman who gave it
to her, might be gradually brought to a genuine sense of appreciation
and gratitude to the city which supplies her little children with a
Kindergarten, or, to the Board of Health which properly placarded a case
of scarlet-fever next door and spared her sleepless nights and wearing
anxiety, as well as the money paid with such difficulty to the doctor
and the druggist. The man who in his emotional gratitude almost kneels
before his political friend who gets his boy out of jail, might be made to see the kindness and good sense
of the city authorities who provided the boy with a playground and
reading room, where he might spend his hours of idleness and
restlessness, and through which his temptations to petty crime might be
averted. A man who is grateful to the alderman who sees that his
gambling and racing are not interfered with, might learn to feel loyal
and responsible to the city which supplied him with a gymnasium and
swimming tank where manly and well-conducted sports are possible. The
voter who is eager to serve the alderman at all times, because the
tenure of his job is dependent upon aldermanic favor, might find great
relief and pleasure in working for the city in which his place was
secured by a well-administered civil service law.</p>

<p>After all, what the corrupt alderman demands from his followers and
largely depends upon is a sense of loyalty, a standing-by the man who is
good to you, who understands you, and who gets you out of trouble. All the social life of the voter
from the time he was a little boy and played "craps" with his "own
push," and not with some other "push," has been founded on this sense of
loyalty and of standing in with his friends. Now that he is a man, he
likes the sense of being inside a political organization, of being
trusted with political gossip, of belonging to a set of fellows who
understand things, and whose interests are being cared for by a strong
friend in the city council itself. All this is perfectly legitimate, and
all in the line of the development of a strong civic loyalty, if it were
merely socialized and enlarged. Such a voter has already proceeded in
the forward direction in so far as he has lost the sense of isolation,
and has abandoned the conviction that city government does not touch his
individual affairs. Even Mill claims that the social feelings of man,
his desire to be at unity with his fellow-creatures, are the natural
basis for morality, and he defines a man of
high moral culture as one who thinks of himself, not as an isolated
individual, but as a part in a social organism.</p>

<p>Upon this foundation it ought not to be difficult to build a structure
of civic virtue. It is only necessary to make it clear to the voter that
his individual needs are common needs, that is, public needs, and that
they can only be legitimately supplied for him when they are supplied
for all. If we believe that the individual struggle for life may widen
into a struggle for the lives of all, surely the demand of an individual
for decency and comfort, for a chance to work and obtain the fulness of
life may be widened until it gradually embraces all the members of the
community, and rises into a sense of the common weal.</p>

<p>In order, however, to give him a sense of conviction that his individual
needs must be merged into the needs of the many, and are only important
as they are thus merged, the appeal cannot be made along the line of
self-interest. The demand should be
universalized; in this process it would also become clarified, and the
basis of our political organization become perforce social and ethical.</p>

<p>Would it be dangerous to conclude that the corrupt politician himself,
because he is democratic in method, is on a more ethical line of social
development than the reformer, who believes that the people must be made
over by "good citizens" and governed by "experts"? The former at least
are engaged in that great moral effort of getting the mass to express
itself, and of adding this mass energy and wisdom to the community as a
whole.</p>

<p>The wide divergence of experience makes it difficult for the good
citizen to understand this point of view, and many things conspire to
make it hard for him to act upon it. He is more or less a victim to that
curious feeling so often possessed by the good man, that the righteous
do not need to be agreeable, that their goodness alone is sufficient,
and that they can leave the arts and wiles of
securing popular favor to the self-seeking. This results in a certain
repellent manner, commonly regarded as the apparel of righteousness, and
is further responsible for the fatal mistake of making the surroundings
of "good influences" singularly unattractive; a mistake which really
deserves a reprimand quite as severe as the equally reprehensible deed
of making the surroundings of "evil influences" so beguiling. Both are
akin to that state of mind which narrows the entrance into a wider
morality to the eye of a needle, and accounts for the fact that new
moral movements have ever and again been inaugurated by those who have
found themselves in revolt against the conventionalized good.</p>

<p>The success of the reforming politician who insists upon mere purity of
administration and upon the control and suppression of the unruly
elements in the community, may be the easy result of a narrowing and
selfish process. For the painful condition of endeavoring to minister to genuine social needs, through the political
machinery, and at the same time to remodel that machinery so that it
shall be adequate to its new task, is to encounter the inevitable
discomfort of a transition into a new type of democratic relation. The
perplexing experiences of the actual administration, however, have a
genuine value of their own. The economist who treats the individual
cases as mere data, and the social reformer who labors to make such
cases impossible, solely because of the appeal to his reason, may have
to share these perplexities before they feel themselves within the grasp
of a principle of growth, working outward from within; before they can
gain the exhilaration and uplift which comes when the individual
sympathy and intelligence is caught into the forward intuitive movement
of the mass. This general movement is not without its intellectual
aspects, but it has to be transferred from the region of perception to
that of emotion before it is really apprehended. The mass of men seldom move together without an
emotional incentive. The man who chooses to stand aside, avoids much of
the perplexity, but at the same time he loses contact with a great
source of vitality.</p>

<p>Perhaps the last and greatest difficulty in the paths of those who are
attempting to define and attain a social morality, is that which arises
from the fact that they cannot adequately test the value of their
efforts, cannot indeed be sure of their motives until their efforts are
reduced to action and are presented in some workable form of social
conduct or control. For action is indeed the sole medium of expression
for ethics. We continually forget that the sphere of morals is the
sphere of action, that speculation in regard to morality is but
observation and must remain in the sphere of intellectual comment, that
a situation does not really become moral until we are confronted with
the question of what shall be done in a concrete case, and are obliged
to act upon our theory. A stirring appeal has
lately been made by a recognized ethical lecturer who has declared that
"It is insanity to expect to receive the data of wisdom by looking on.
We arrive at moral knowledge only by tentative and observant practice.
We learn how to apply the new insight by having attempted to apply the
old and having found it to fail."</p>

<p>This necessity of reducing the experiment to action throws out of the
undertaking all timid and irresolute persons, more than that, all those
who shrink before the need of striving forward shoulder to shoulder with
the cruder men, whose sole virtue may be social effort, and even that
not untainted by self-seeking, who are indeed pushing forward social
morality, but who are doing it irrationally and emotionally, and often
at the expense of the well-settled standards of morality.</p>

<p>The power to distinguish between the genuine effort and the adventitious
mistakes is perhaps the most difficult test which comes to our fallible
intelligence. In the range of individual
morals, we have learned to distrust him who would reach spirituality by
simply renouncing the world, or by merely speculating upon its evils.
The result, as well as the process of virtues attained by repression,
has become distasteful to us. When the entire moral energy of an
individual goes into the cultivation of personal integrity, we all know
how unlovely the result may become; the character is upright, of course,
but too coated over with the result of its own endeavor to be
attractive. In this effort toward a higher morality in our social
relations, we must demand that the individual shall be willing to lose
the sense of personal achievement, and shall be content to realize his
activity only in connection with the activity of the many.</p>

<p>The cry of "Back to the people" is always heard at the same time, when
we have the prophet's demand for repentance or the religious cry of
"Back to Christ," as though we would seek refuge with our fellows and believe in our common experiences as a
preparation for a new moral struggle.</p>

<p>As the acceptance of democracy brings a certain life-giving power, so it
has its own sanctions and comforts. Perhaps the most obvious one is the
curious sense which comes to us from time to time, that we belong to the
whole, that a certain basic well being can never be taken away from us
whatever the turn of fortune. Tolstoy has portrayed the experience in
"Master and Man." The former saves his servant from freezing, by
protecting him with the heat of his body, and his dying hours are filled
with an ineffable sense of healing and well-being. Such experiences, of
which we have all had glimpses, anticipate in our relation to the living
that peace of mind which envelopes us when we meditate upon the great
multitude of the dead. It is akin to the assurance that the dead
understand, because they have entered into the Great Experience, and
therefore must comprehend all lesser ones; that all the
misunderstandings we have in life are due to
partial experience, and all life's fretting comes of our limited
intelligence; when the last and Great Experience comes, it is, perforce,
attended by mercy and forgiveness. Consciously to accept Democracy and
its manifold experiences is to anticipate that peace and freedom.</p>
